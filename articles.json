Over 4 consecutive days this week China sent a record number of 149 jets to conduct sorties inside Taiwan\u2019s Air Defence Identification Zone. China considers Taiwan a part of its territory, although since 1949 it has been controlled by a separate government. The sorties came as the US UK and allies conducted military exercises in the region, passing south of Taiwan, including the British carrier Queen Elizabeth, the first time it has sent this kind of ship and flotilla since 1997. Also follows the first Quad summit in Washington and the announcement of the AUKUS partnership for nuclear submarines in Australia Taiwanese Defence Minister called it the worst situation in 40 years, and Taiwanese President Tsai Ing Wen wrote in an article that Taiwan will never bow to Chinese pressure The US, which criticised the flights, counselled restraint, President Biden said the US and China will abide by their earlier agreements. At a meeting in Zurich US NSA Jake Sullivan and Chinese State Councillor Yang Jiechi set the stage for a virtual summit between Biden and Xi in the next two months. The Taiwan situation also came up during a visit to Delhi by US Dy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, who called the Chinese strikes a very dangerous action. IAF chief said he would not\u00a0 comment on an issue between two other parties -\u00a0 Instability in the region -\u00a0 Government is already dealing with Chinese aggression at the LAC, would like to avoid actions that would precipitate more violence -\u00a0 India\u2019s membership of the Quad- with US, Japan and Australia is committed to keeping the Indo-Pacific region free and open -\u00a0 India is also a member of SCO, BRICS, RIC with China -\u00a0 1949: India recognised PRC, not the ROC as the government in Taiwan calls itself, and adopted the \u201cOne China policy\u201d -\u00a0 Relations with Taipei were more or less frozen through the Cold war era -\u00a0 1995: India-Taipei association was established, and led to the setting up of an Indian office in Taipei, and the Taipei Economic and Cultural Centre in Delhi- but while they both issue visas, they are not the equivalent of diplomatic relations -\u00a0 India has always been sensitive to China\u2019s concerns, but after a number of Chinese aggressions at the Line of Actual Control in 2010, comments on Arunachal Pradesh, as well visa issue on Jammu Kashmir, India stopped the use of the \u201cOne China Policy\u201d -\u00a0 In 2011 Delhi and Taipei signed a \u201cDouble Taxation Avoidance Agreement\u201d and \u201cCustoms Mutual Assistance Agreement\u201d in July 2011 -\u00a0 In 2018, Delhi and Taipei signed a bilateral investment agreement -\u00a0 As Chinese PLA aggressions at the Line of Actual Control led to the Galwan killings in 2020, calls for India to step up its ties with Taiwan have grown, coupled with questions about whether India, as a newly active member of the Quad will take a more vocal approach on China-Taiwan developments, or remain sensitive to its ties with Beijing. For the moment the latter seems the more likely option. Remember, The United Nations and most countries recognise the PRC in Beijing as the sole legal government of China (which means they don\u2019t recognise the ROC in Taipei). Currently fifteen states recognise Taiwan as the ROC (and thus do not have official relations with Beijing): Belize, Guatemala, Haiti, Holy See, Honduras, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Nicaragua, Palau, Paraguay, St Lucia, St Kitts and Nevis, St Vincent and the Grenadines, Swaziland and Tuvalu.

He has already called time on leading the country in the T20 after the World Cup in November, and he might be tempted to bow out as captain in the white ball game altogether. He doesn\u2019t need to decide now; anything that reduces his workload can only be good for Indian cricket as it will free up the best batsman in the world. Kohli, one of the most successful of international captains, with a win percentage of nearly 64 in all formats combined, will thus find an asterisk against his captaincy record in domestic cricket. He was a terrific captain for RCB when things were going well, but less so at other times. As India\u2019s Test wins in Australia in particular, and later England (under Kohli\u2019s captaincy) showed, a team is more than a collection of individuals.  RCB have often been a collection of outstanding individuals but fell short year after year. Kohli must take some of the blame. You can argue that the KKR defeat on Monday was hastened by three sixes in succession by Sunil Narine, and that sort of thing can happen any time. True. But under pressure, RCB didn\u2019t have anybody hitting sixes, and bad luck in different forms cannot be a perennial excuse (not that the RCB are saying this). The IPL is about winning, and not just taking part. Corporates tend to be impatient, looking for a quick ego-massaging win. This was exemplified by the RCB sacking their first CEO midway through the inaugural season. No corporate honcho who has paid millions to acquire a franchise and everything that goes with it, the glamour and power, is likely to have an excess of patience. That Kohli jumped before he was pushed is a tribute to his standing in the game and his marketability, two qualities more important to his owners than either a pleasing cover drive or an innovative pull. The latter qualities will be retained by RCB \u2014 Kohli told us that in 2016 when he led the team into the final, and then again after the defeat that knocked them out of the tournament this year. Such loyalty is rare in professional sport. In the early years, RCB lacked balance both during the auctions and in the ground, with ego rather than cricket thinking dominating. They got it wrong in the inaugural year, picking established Test players (Jacques Kallis, Rahul Dravid, Wasim Jaffar) who played T20 as a shorter version of Test cricket. It was a time when all teams were feeling their way in the new format, convinced it was a batsman\u2019s game, and unsure just what the tactics ought to be. But by the time Kohli took over in 2013 as a 24-year-old India captain-in-waiting, things had settled down to a large extent. Bowling had come into its own and bowlers had worked out how to deal with marauding batsmen. I think it was Dravid who pointed out an important aspect of T20 cricket: that, while a bowler has a guaranteed 24 deliveries, a batsman might have 60 one day and just one on another.  And although RCB invested in bowlers like Dale Steyn, Zaheer Khan and Mitchell Starc, the chopping and changing meant that there was neither a balanced attack nor a settled team. Interestingly, the players RCB let go, like Dravid, Gayle or K.L. Rahul did well for the teams that grabbed them. This suggests a management failure. There is some relief for the purist in knowing that all the money you spend cannot guarantee success. Balance, trust, understanding, communication all matter. Rajasthan Royals who won the inaugural tournament spent less than the others but chose wisely, with Shane Warne as captain. When Kohli took over, and in his early years in charge, he had the three best batsmen in the competition, Chris Gayle, A.B. de Villiers and himself. RCB got themselves into a position where if two of these three struck, then the remaining batsmen were not necessary. But crucially, if none of them did, then they often lacked the batsmen who were necessary. Not surprisingly, they have recorded both the highest (263 for 5) and the lowest (49) totals in the tournament. RCB\u2019s is a cautionary tale for teams in the competition. Of the original eight, Delhi and Punjab are the only other teams not to win the title.  Next year, there will be two new teams and in December-January another auction and later another chance on the field of play. Each of these requires a special set of skills. Some teams have it down to a fine art. RCB are still looking for the magic formula.

I am a 39-year-old single mother with a 14-year-old daughter. I am employed with a leading NBFC. My monthly gross earnings come to \u20b972,000 and net take home is \u20b951,000 (after deduction of VPF of \u20b910,000 over and above my regular deductions). I have nil liabilities. I used to invest \u20b917,000 per month (now stopped as I didn't want to put all eggs in one basket) in various SIPs, a monthly LIC premium of \u20b96,000 (continuing), \u20b95,000 monthly for NPS and \u20b910,000 as monthly RD for 12 months. Kindly advise as to how I can further build my wealth. Do I need to restart my SIPs or continue with my savings habit? Jayalakshmi A. Your VPF, recurring deposit and NPS alone make up \u20b925,000 per month of savings and investment. We are not counting your LIC premium as investment unless you are invested in any market-linked plans there. Your current savings ae commendable. Please keep it up! Investing in mutual fund SIPs does not mean you are putting all eggs in one basket as long as you are investing in a good mix of equity and debt funds. Without equity, even the best of savings and investment habits may not fetch you inflation-beating returns in the long term. You will have some equities through your NPS but that is unlikely to be sufficient. Yes, a wrong mutual fund product that is mis-sold can lead to trouble. To avoid this, ask for simple Nifty, Nifty 500 and Nifty Next 50 index equity funds. These are low-commission products and few will offer you the option unless you ask.  These will reduce the need to maintain your portfolio as they are passive funds, mimicking the market. With this, mix some simple ultra-short, short-duration and banking and PSU funds and restart your SIP. Do not worry if the market falls, as long as you are investing for a minimum of 7 years. For any short-term goals, use safe avenues such as bank deposits. Q. I am 26 years old; I work in a private IT firm. My net monthly income is \u20b957,000 and I have investments of \u20b96,200 per month as LIC premium and spend \u20b98,000 per month on room rent. But still, tax is getting deducted from my salary. Could you please recommend some long-term investment plans that could save me from paying tax in future and which I could start on soon? Aditya Rai A.The easiest you can do is to ask your employer to deduct a higher provident fund \u2014 called voluntary provident fund. This will provide you with a higher tax deduction since it is unlikely your current PF is large enough to get full deduction under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. Other than this, you can consider opening a PPF account. If you are a risk taker, tax-saving funds (ELSS) also work. Q. I recently retired from a manager\u2019s post at a government undertaking; I received about \u20b91 crore as superannuation benefits. Now, I have about \u20b92 crore, including my life-long savings . About 90% of the amount has been deposited in multiple banks as fixed deposits. Kindly guide me on investing the sum to get better returns on investments to beat inflation. Tariq Khan A. Our first suggestion to manage your corpus is to go for a fee-based financial planner and do a cash flow to ensure that the corpus lasts through your retired years. Avoid using agents and distributors for this purpose. If not, considering the following: keep an emergency corpus that is 3-6 months of your expenses in large public or private banks that are systemically important. This would be SBI, ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank.  For regular income, invest up to \u20b915 lakh in the Senior Citizens\u2019 scheme if you have turned 60. If you are less than 60, then you will have to stick to FDs and RBI Floating Rate Bonds we have mentioned further down. Similarly at 60, use LIC\u2019s Pradhan Mantri Vaya Vandhana Yojana \u2014 a safe pension plan. This also has a limit of \u20b915 lakh. Post these two, consider RBI\u2019s Floating Rate Savings Bond, available with select large banks, including SBI, and select brokerages. This has no limit and is sovereign guaranteed. Interest is floating but will always be 35 basis points above the NSC rate. Stick to fixed deposits across large private and public sector banks and perhaps use a couple of small finance banks for FDs (for slightly higher interest) up to \u20b95 lakh each. \u20b95 lakh is the amount up to which there will be insurance cover for your bank FD. Avoid going to risky banks beyond this amount. Q. I am due for retirement from government service in a few months. I would be getting a significant amount at the time of retirement. I have a home loan worth a few tens of lakhs. Is it wise to pay back the home loan? What are the best options for investments? Suresh A. It is best to start your retired life without any liabilities. To this extent, if you have a large corpus and you will also earn a pension, you must consider closing your loan, even if it fetches you tax benefits. On investments, you can go for a mix of Senior Citizens\u2019 Savings Scheme, RBI Floating Rate Savings Bond, LIC\u2019s Vaya Vandhana Yojana and some 10-15% in equity index mutual funds. Add the equity index funds only if you do not need this part of your corpus for the next 5-10 years.

According to the Haryana police, on October 15, they received information that near the protest site (where farmers are protesting the Centre\u2019s farm laws) at the Singhu border, \u201cthe Nihangs have hanged and tied a man to a barricade and his hand was chopped off\u201d. By the time the police reached the spot, the victim had died. The deceased, identified as Lakhbir, a resident of Punjab\u2019s Tarn Taran, was tied to the barricade with his left wrist and a foot partially severed. Later in the evening, Sarabjit, a Nihang Sikh, surrendered, taking responsibility for the murder. The matter is still under investigation. In April 2020, a group of Nihangs allegedly attacked police officials and cut off the hand of one of the officers at a vegetable market in Punjab\u2019s Patiala during the COVID-19 nationwide restrictions. Police later arrested several people in connection with the incident. A huge cache of handheld weapons, such as \u2018barchhe,\u2019 \u2018kirpans\u2019 and some used cartridges, were seized from the accused, in addition to five bags of poppy husk mixed with \u2018sulpha\u2019 and other drugs in commercial quantity. Nihangs or Nihang Singhs, originally known as Akalis or Akali Nihangs, are designated the Guru\u2019s knights or the Guru\u2019s beloved, and their origin is associated with the founding of the \u2018Khalsa Panth\u2019 by the 10th Sikh Guru, Gobind Singh. They constitute a distinctive order among Sikhs and are readily recognised by their dark blue loose apparel and their ample, peaked turbans festooned with quoits, insignia of the Khalsa and rosaries, all made of steel. They are always armed and are usually seen mounted heavily laden with weapons such as swords, daggers, spears, rifles, shotguns and pistols. According to professor Sarabjinder Singh, Dean, Faculty of Humanities and Religious Studies, Guru Nanak Dev University in Amritsar, the term \u2018Nihang\u2019 signifies the characteristic qualities of the clan \u2014 their freedom from fear of danger or death, readiness for action and non-attachment to worldly possessions. Prof. Singh said the Nihangs are today divided into several groups, each with its own \u201cchhaoni\u201d (cantonment) but are loosely organised into two \u201cdals\u201d (forces) \u2014 Buddha Dal and Taruna Dal, names initially given to the two sections into which the \u2018Khalsa\u2019 army was divided in 1733. \u201cThe Buddha Dal has its headquarters at Talvandi Sabo, in Bathinda district, while the principal cantonment of the Taruna Dal Nihangs is at Baba Bakala in Amritsar district. \u201cAnandpur Sahib, the birthplace of the Khalsa, remains the main centre of Nihang gatherings. They assemble there in the thousands in March every year to celebrate Hola Mahalla, a Sikh festival introduced by Guru Gobind Singh. On that occasion, they hold tournaments of military skills, including mock battles. The most spectacular part of the Hola Mahalla in Anandpur is the magnificent procession of Nihangs on horses and elephants and on foot in their typical costumes, carrying a variety of traditional and modern weapons and demonstrating their skill in using them,\u201d he said. \u201cApart from their distinguishable mode of dress, the Nihangs try to preserve the form and content of the Khalsa practice established by Guru Gobind Singh and strictly observed by the early Akalis of the eighteenth century,\u201d Prof. Singh added.

It\u2019s true that the \u2018official statement\u2019 has some way to go before it attains the literary stature of a novel, sonnet or narrative nonfiction. But it has, in the last eight months, evolved rapidly in the choppy waters of Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and several other social media you don\u2019t give a Koo about. A characteristic of the most memorable specimens of the modern and even the post-modern official statement is an inspiring paragraph or two on the statement-giver\u2019s mental health challenges. Constellation of symptoms So, am I depressed? My stakeholders tell me I should avoid any reference to depression. Their logic: By referring to mental health in my official statement, I could be opening myself to accusations of trivialising mental health concerns. After all, would it not be construed as offensive if I were to state in this statement that the likelihood of people taking offence at anything I may say (about depression or anything else) could be causing me depression or a depression-like variant with a constellation of symptoms that mimic depression without actually qualifying for the title, as it were, purely on clinical merit? Be that as it may, for all these reasons, and with deep regret, I would like to announce that I am stepping back, with immediate effect, from all my responsibilities as a rights-bearing citizen of a constitutional democracy. This is a completely personal decision and has nothing whatsoever to do with the erosion of the rule of law in my country or with the climate of fear and self-censorship or with the pervasive loss of faith in the capacity of the country\u2019s institutions to protect the democratic rights of ordinary Indians and the even more ordinary media. Oh by jingo!  Notwithstanding the above, I shall continue to fulfill my duties as a proud nationalist and avid jingoist. That is to say, whether or not I love my fellow Indians \u2014 especially those that don\u2019t belong to my own religion, caste or class \u2014 I shall continue to love my country\u2019s territorial boundaries. This follows naturally from my longstanding belief that there is nothing in the universe more worthy of adoration than the Government of India and the moral giants that run it. I wish to take this opportunity to also express my gratitude to the Government of India for providing national security to every single citizen of India. This is all the more creditable given that millions of Indians still do not enjoy job security, food security, healthcare security, education security or survival security. Some people might be thinking: it\u2019s all very well to focus on protecting our borders, but what about the people living within those borders? Don\u2019t they deserve protection from hunger, malnutrition, disease, police atrocities, and vigilante violence just as they deserve protection from terrorist violence and Pakistan? My advice to these misguided souls: kindly volunteer yourself to be investigated by the ED for money-laundering, NCB for drug-possession, and NIA for waging constitution jihad. In conclusion, I just want to say that understanding whatever and one\u2019s relationship with whatever is a very important thing, and in this difficult time, I request all of you to respect my privacy and give me the space I need. The space I need is located in Australia and costs a lot of money. So don\u2019t forget what I said about crowd-funding. G. Sampath, author of this satire, is Social Affairs Editor, The Hindu.

However, building or maintaining a high credit score through responsible behaviour is a continuous process. One needs to be aware of \u2018good and desirable\u2019 actions that impact your credit score positively and stay away from the bad ones. Here are some common myths around credit scores: Checking my credit score frequently will lower the score When you apply for any kind of loan or a credit card, the lender fetches your credit report from a credit bureau to gauge your creditworthiness. This is commonly known as a \u2018hard enquiry.\u2019 Too many hard enquiries from lenders within a short span can reduce your score as it indicates credit hungriness.  However, when you check your credit score on your own, it is known as a \u2018soft enquiry.\u2019 Soft enquiries have no impact on your score. In fact, it is advised to check your credit report every 2 or 3 months, to track your credit score and take action to build it. Regularly checking your credit score can also help detect errors that may emerge in your credit report. My score will improve with increase in income Your credit score is determined by your behaviour with credit and is not related to income. Missing EMI repayments, high credit-utilisation ratio, frequent and multiple applications for loans and cards can severely damage your credit score, irrespective of your income. However, higher income does impact your overall loan eligibility, as it reflects higher repayment capacity. Despite a strong credit score, those with lower income may not be eligible for select credit cards or high-ticket loans.  Settling a credit account helps in improving credit score Settling your loan or credit card account is different from closing your loan or card account. Closure of an account means deactivating a loan or credit card after full repayment of outstanding dues as per schedule, with no outstanding amount remaining. When one is unable to pay the outstanding amount for some time, the lender may choose to extend the option to settle the account through a one-time payment option, where a certain amount of the debt may also be written off. When you decide to settle your credit account, the credit bureaus are informed; this starts reflecting in your credit report as a \u2018settled\u2019 account. You need to know this \u2018settled\u2019 account remains in your credit report for a long time, and all your future loan or credit card applications are likely to be adversely impacted.  Since you missed repaying as per the schedule and settled the account, lenders will consider you as a \u2018risky\u2019 borrower in future and may be hesitant to approve your loan or credit card applications. Banks will lend to me because I have never taken any credit in the past Many people assume that having no loans or credit cards can makes it easy for them to avail credit as they do not have any existing credit obligations to fulfil. This is not correct. Having active credit accounts and displaying good repayment behaviour against them is a positive sign for lenders. If you have fared well with your credit obligations in the past and continue to do so, your risk of defaulting in future is relatively less and you can get credit approval with better offers and at preferential rates. On the other hand, indiscipline in handling credit in the past makes you a risky customer and bureaus give you a low credit score making it difficult to avail loans and cards.  But, if you have never taken any loan or credit card in your life, you do not have any credit history. Having no credit history leaves providers with no data to analyse the risk of credit provided to new to credit applicants. Many large lenders refrain from approving credit applications of such applicants. If you are new to credit, you also miss out on pre-approved loans and card offers from various lenders, apart from several benefits such as preferential rates. Closing old credit cards is good for my credit score We often tend to close old credit cards to save annual fees or just because we don\u2019t use them any more. However, this may not be advisable if you do not have a long credit history, haven\u2019t availed many credit products, or have a low credit score. Before closing an old credit card, do consider a couple of aspects.  First, it\u2019s always good to have a good mix of credit products in your portfolio because it shows your ability to manage different types of credit. So, before closing an old credit card, do take a close look at the total account in your credit report. If you have not taken too many credit products, you may want to continue with the card for a stronger product mix. Second, lenders look at the length of your credit history when you apply for any kind of loan or a credit card and, having a credit card here with a long history and good repayment record may help. So, if your credit history with other credit products is not very long, continuing with an older credit card is recommended. Also, remember that when you close a credit card, your credit limit would reduce, which may lead to a higher credit utilisation ratio that would negatively impact your score.

(Sign up to our Technology newsletter, Today's Cache, for insights on emerging themes at the intersection of technology, business and policy. Click here to subscribe for free.) 5G technology was designed to be faster than 4G wireless, with so little latency to help make things like driverless cars possible. 5G running on low band spectrum is the slowest, but it has the advantage of considerable range while mid-band can't travel as far, but is faster. High band spectrum, which is sparsely available, may travel only a mile but is by far the fastest. An analysis done by OpenSignal released on Thursday found that their testers connected with T-Mobile 5G just 34.7% of the time, AT&T 16.4% of the time and Verizon just 9.7%. And that's generally not for the fastest 5G many expect. The numbers are in stark contrast to what the carriers promise about 5G in their advertisements, showing how much they are banking on 5G as a selling point in the hotly-contested market for cellular service. T-Mobile advertises that it has \"America's largest, fastest, and most reliable 5G network\" with a map covered almost completely in pink, suggesting broad coverage. The map does not distinguish what type of 5G a customer will get, but the fine print states its a mix of lower-performing versions. Top-performing \"ultra capacity\" 5G coverage, meanwhile, is only available in \"hundreds of cities and (for) millions of people\" instead of most of the country. Also Read | Vodafone Idea claims to record peak 5G speed of 3.7 gbps during trials in Pune AT&T says it has the \"most reliable 5G network,\" citing a test done for AT&T by Global Wireless Solutions, which evaluates mobile networks. The company notes, however, that its high speed 5G+ is \"available in select high-speed zones and venues in over 20 states across the U.S.\" Asked about what appears to be a disparity between advertising and coverage, T-Mobile's Grant Castle, a vice president in network engineering, said that he thought the company is doing well. \"Is our network as big and broad as I would like it to be? No, we're still working on it,\" said Castle. Andre Fuetsch, chief technical officer, Network Services at AT&T, said in an emailed statement that 5G \"is still early in its lifecycle and is being evolved and enhanced through ongoing investment and innovation.\" The BBB National Programs' National Advertising Division has criticized claims made about 5G by all three of the companies, including one in August that prompted Verizon to change its claim about it being the \"most reliable\" to indicate that it did not specifically refer to 5G service. \"5G right now is (in) the fake it until you make it stage,\" said Harold Feld, of advocacy group Public Knowledge which promotes affordable communication, adding that when new technology is developed, advertising often gets ahead of actual deployment. Also Read | Nokia says telcos building pan-India 5G capacity to drive its biz growth Low income neighborhoods, and to some extent rural areas, are generally the last to get new technology, said Christopher Mitchell of the advocacy group Institute for Local Self Reliance. Mitchell said that what is touted as 5G in rural areas is often just \"incrementally faster 4G.\" \"We're not expecting to see the super fast 5G in many rural areas. T-Mobile has been better about that,\" he said. \"I feel like there's been a lot of dishonesty in the advertising.\" Internationally, the story is similar. South Korea tops the list of best 5G availability at 28.1% of the time, with Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Hong Kong all above 25%, according to an OpenSignal report from early September.

Explained | Who are the Nihangs? Narain, a member of the Nihang Sikh community from Amarkot village, was arrested by the Amritsar rural police. News agencies reported late in the evening that two more persons, belonging to the Nihang order from Fatehgarh Sahib in Punjab, had \u201csurrendered\u201d before the Sonipat police in Kundli in connection with the killing. Lakhbir Singh, a resident of Tarn Taran in Punjab, was found dead at Sonipat in Haryana on Friday. The body was tied to a police barricade with the wrist and leg severed. He was \u201cpunished\u201d for allegedly desecrating the holy Sikh scripture. The prime accused Sarabjit, also a Nihang Sikh, who was arrested by the Haryana police a few hours after the murder, was remanded in police custody for seven days by the District and Sessions Court in Sonipat on Saturday. Soon after his arrest, Narain claimed that he had informed the Senior Superintendent of Police, Amritsar, over phone that he wanted to surrender. He said he had sought permission to visit the Akal Takht, but the police took him into custody near Jandiala town, around 25 km from Amritsar. Talking to reporters before his arrest, Narain said Lakhbir was \u201cpunished\u201d allegedly for the sacrilege. Members of many Sikh outfits reportedly garlanded him with currency notes when he paid obeisance at a gurdwara. Singhu border murder | SGPC backs farm unions amid BJP attack The Samyukt Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of farmer organisations protesting against the three farm laws, has demanded an investigation into \u201cthe allegation of conspiracy to sabotage the movement through sacrilege and promotion of disturbance by hurting religious sentiments\u201d. \u201cFrom media reports from the victim's village and family, it appears that he had been receiving mysterious calls which he would take in secrecy. Victim Lakhbir Singh is supposed to have told his sister that \u2018his reach has increased now and has gone far\u2019. After a wedding in the village, he is supposed to have gone away with someone in the attire of a Nihang Sikh and landed up with a Nihang group in Singhu Border since then. All this information points to a deep conspiracy of some sort as SKM has been pointing out,\u201d the Morcha said in a statement. The autopsy report of Lakhbir has revealed 37 wounds, including six wounds caused by sharp-edged and pointed weapons. \u201cThe rest are lacerated and abrasion wounds caused by blunt weapons. The report attributed the death to haemorrhagic shock,\u201d said Virender Singh, Deputy Superintendent of Police, Law and Order, Sonipat. Singhu border murder | Victim's family demands high-level probe Later in the afternoon Lakhbir Singh was cremated at his native village in Punjab's Tarn Taran amid tight security in the presence of his family members. No Sikh priest was present to perform Ardas (Sikh funeral prayer) and no one from his village,Cheema Kalan, attended the last rites. \u201cSarabjit has named four people, including Narain Singh, for their involvement in the murder. He said that more people were involved and he could identify them,\u201d Mr. Singh told The Hindu. Producing Sarabjit before the court of Kimmi Singla, Judicial Magistrate First Class, the Haryana Police sought 14 days remand for the identification of the co-accused in the case and recovery of the murder weapon and blood-stained clothes. \u201cThe police told the court that the accused was to be taken to Punjab\u2019s Chamkaur Sahib and Gurdaspur for the identification and arrest of the co-accused. They also pleaded that the murder weapon and the blood-stained clothes of the accused were to be seized from Kundli,\u201d said Sarabjit\u2019s counsel Monarch Bhardwaj. Singhu border murder | Provide compensation to kin of victim: Mayawati Mr. Bhardwaj said the court directed the police to make a Daily Dairy entry at the local police station whenever he was taken away in connection with the investigation during his custody and conduct daily medical examination.

Many power plants are operating with zero reserve stock or with stocks that could last just a few days. Some States have witnessed partial load-shedding aimed at saving power. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, however, is reported to have termed worries about a possible shortage of coal and power supplies \u201cabsolutely baseless\u201d and is said to have asserted during the course of a trip to the U.S. that India is now a power-surplus country. According to data released by the Central Electricity Authority, as of Wednesday, India\u2019s 135 thermal power plants overall had on average coal stock that would last just four days. In all, 112 of the 135 power plants are operating with stocks that are at critical or super-critical levels. The government usually mandates the power plants to hold stocks that would last at least two weeks. It has, however, reduced this requirement to 10 days now to avoid hoarding and ensure more equitable distribution of coal among the plants. India relies on coal to meet over 70% of its power needs, and Coal India Limited (CIL) supplies over 80% of the total coal. The current coal crisis comes amid a broader energy crisis across the world with the prices of natural gas, coal and oil rising sharply in the international market.  \n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nCentre rebuts fears of power blackouts \n\n\n\n\u00a0 \nCentre rebuts fears of power blackouts  The current crisis in the availability of coal has been the result of lacklustre domestic production and a sharp drop in imports over the last few years. According to BP Global Energy Statistics, domestic coal production in India has stagnated since 2018. It peaked at 12.80 exajoules (EJ) worth of coal in 2018. At the same time, the amount of coal imported from other countries to meet domestic demand, too, has dropped significantly. Coal imports have dropped from the peak of 6.46 EJ in 2016 to 4.22 EJ in 2020. Stagnating supply did not cause trouble last year with the economy shut down to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. But the rise in power demand this year has exposed the government\u2019s inability to push domestic production or compensate for insufficient domestic production by increasing imports. In fact, the government last year said it would stop all coal imports by FY24. Many factors have been blamed for the insufficient supply of coal this year. These include short-term issues like flooding in coal-mining areas, transport issues, labour disruptions in major coal-mining countries and the sudden rise in power demand as the economy revives from the pandemic. But it should be noted that deeper structural problems have plagued the power industry in general for long. Populist politics has ensured that the price that many consumers pay for power is not commensurate with the production costs. In FY19, for instance, the revenues of distribution companies covered only about 70% of their total costs. This has discouraged private investment in power generation and distribution even as the demand for power continues to rise each year. It has also increased the debt burden on public sector distribution companies as they have not been compensated for the losses they incur while selling power at subsidised rates. According to the credit rating agency ICRA, the consolidated debt of public sector distribution companies is expected to hit \u20b9 6 trillion in FY22. It should also be noted that the mining of raw materials such as coal is nearly monopolised by public sector companies like CIL that are not run primarily for profits. In fact, CIL has kept the price of its coal low even as international prices have risen significantly this year. It has also been forced to share some of the pain of power generation and distribution companies.  \n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nPower Ministry asks States to utilise unallocated power from central plants\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \nPower Ministry asks States to utilise unallocated power from central plants\n According to the government, indebted power generators and distributors owe over \u20b921,000 crore to CIL. So, overall, there is very little financial incentive that major producers across the supply chain, including miners, possess to ramp up production.   In recent years, many countries have been trying to cut down on their fossil fuel consumption in order to meet emission targets. But with the current energy crunch, which is prevalent not just in India, fossil fuels are likely to make a strong comeback. India and China, the top two consumers of coal in the world, are expected to further increase production of fossil fuels. The Indian government has been pushing CIL to ramp up production to meet the rising demand and cut down on the country\u2019s reliance on imported coal. However, it is expected to ease restrictions on imported coal in the near future to tide over the crisis. The government last week mandated the thermal power plants to blend imported coal with domestic coal up to a limit of 10%. Meanwhile, China, which consumes half of the world\u2019s coal output and has committed itself to reducing its carbon emissions by 65% by 2030, is set to install more coal-powered power plants to meet its rising energy needs. Structural problems that have plagued the Indian power industry, however, are unlikely to be resolved anytime soon. Allowing the price that consumers pay for power to be determined by market forces is likely to remain politically unpopular, so fundamental pricing reform is unlikely. But with coal selling at high prices in the international market and CIL unable to meet production targets, many power generators may be unable to increase their output unless they are allowed to price their output freely. \n\n\n\nWatch | India on the brink of a power crisis due to coal shortage\n\n\n \n\n\n ", "title": "Explained | What is the extent of India\u2019s coal crisis? - The Hindu", "author": "Prashanth Perumal J.", "date": "October 17, 2021 03:45 IST", "preprocessed": "stori india could verg power crisi stock coal held countri thermal power plant critic level mani power plant oper zero reserv stock stock could last state partial load shed save power financ minist nirmala sitharaman howev report term worri possibl shortag coal power suppli absolut baseless said assert cours trip india power surplu countri accord data releas central electr author wednesday india thermal power plant overal averag coal stock would last four power plant oper stock critic super critic level govern usual mandat power plant hold stock would last least week howev reduc requir avoid hoard ensur equit distribut coal among plant india reli coal meet power need coal india limit suppli total coal current coal crisi come amid broader energi crisi across world price natur coal rise sharpli intern market also read centr rebut fear power blackout centr rebut fear power blackout current crisi avail coal result lacklustr domest product sharp drop import last year accord global energi statist domest coal product india stagnat sinc 2018 peak exajoul worth coal 2018 time amount coal import countri meet domest demand drop significantli coal import drop peak 2016 2020 stagnat suppli caus troubl last year economi shut tackl covid pandem rise power demand year expos govern inabl push domest product compens insuffici domest product increas import fact govern last year said would stop coal import fy24 mani factor blame insuffici suppli coal year includ short term issu like flood coal mine area transport issu labour disrupt major coal mine countri sudden rise power demand economi reviv pandem note deeper structur problem plagu power industri gener long populist polit ensur price mani consum power commensur product cost fy19 instanc revenu distribut compani cover total cost discourag privat invest power gener distribut even demand power continu rise year also increas debt burden public sector distribut compani compens loss incur sell power subsidis rate accord credit rate agenc icra consolid debt public sector distribut compani expect trillion fy22 also note mine materi coal nearli monopolis public sector compani like primarili profit fact kept price coal even intern price risen significantli year also forc share pain power gener distribut compani also read power ministri state utilis unalloc power central plant power ministri state utilis unalloc power central plant accord govern indebt power gener distributor crore overal littl financi incent major produc across suppli chain includ miner poss ramp product recent year mani countri fossil fuel consumpt order meet emiss target current energi crunch preval india fossil fuel like make strong comeback india china consum coal world expect increas product fossil fuel indian govern push ramp product meet rise demand countri relianc import coal howev expect restrict import coal near futur tide crisi govern last week mandat thermal power plant blend import coal domest coal limit meanwhil china consum half world coal output commit reduc carbon emiss 2030 instal coal power power plant meet rise energi need structur problem plagu indian power industri howev unlik resolv anytim soon allow price consum power determin market forc like remain polit unpopular fundament price reform unlik coal sell high price intern market unabl meet product target mani power gener unabl increas output unless allow price output freeli watch india brink power crisi coal shortag"}, {"body": "A book titled Arecanut, edited by the former Director of the Central Plantation Crops Research Institute (CPCRI) P. Chowdappa, has said that arecoline hydrobromide, a major active principle of arecanut, is found to arrest the growth of cancer cells. The book has quoted this from a recent study at the Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, the U.S.  \u201cIn a recent study at the Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, USA, arecoline hydrobromide is found to arrest the growth of cancer cells. It was reported that arecoline hydrobromide inhibited the activity of the enzyme ACAT1 (acetyl-C0A acetyltransferase) which leads to attenuation of cancer cell proliferation and tumour growth in mice (Fan et al., 2016). 9.5.,\u201d a chapter on \u201cbiochemical constituents of arecanut and their effects on human health\u201d in the book, said. The chapter has been written by farm scientists M. Arivalagan, Senthil Amudhan M. and K.B. Hebbar. Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai released the book on early this month. The chapter said: \u201cThe antioxidant activity of arecanut might play an active role in repairing DNA damage in cancer cells. While investigating the effect of aqueous and various organic extracts from different parts of Areca catechu on oxidative DNA damage in human hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cells, it was noticed that the methanol extract of eight-month-old arecanut husk showed a dose dependent inhibition of comet formation while other solvent extracts did not (Phaechamud et al., 2009).\u201d The same chapter concluded: \u201cArecanut in its pure form is not dangerous but has got a plethora of medicinal properties, including curing ulcers, wounds and even cancer. Most of its folklore medicinal properties are now validated by scientific evidences. Detailed studies on the nature of active principle(s) responsible for all these properties and clinical trials on them are warranted to utilise such plant products effectively and profitably as these palms are available in plenty in most of the South and Southeast Asian countries.\u201d Mr. Chowdappa, who is now the Vice-Chancellor, BEST Innovation University, Anantapur, told The Hindu that the book has come out at the right time when arecanut has been allegedly associated with ill-effects of human health. The book highlights the rich history of medicinal properties and scientific evidences supporting the health benefits. He said that apart from ancient Indian systems of medicine, arecanut has been widely used in clinical practices in China and other Southeast Asian countries. Hence, there is a need to conduct proper scientific research before labelling arecanut as carcinogenic. Mr. Chowdappa, who is heading the technical committee of the Arecanut Taskforce, said that rather than unnecessarily blaming arecanut as carcinogenic, let researches be done in different institutes in the country. \u201cLet them (who are blaming it as carcinogenic) prove it with studies,\u201d he added.

The BCCI, on Sunday, invited applications for five posts \u2014 head coach, batting coach, bowling coach, fielding coach for the men\u2019s senior team and the Head - Sports Science and Medicine at the National Cricket Academy. The head coach applicants \u2014 who have played at least 30 Tests or 50 ODIs or have two years experience at international level or three years a rung below it \u2014 have been set a deadline of Oct. 26 to email their application.

While the strategic purpose of the visits is to discuss the U.K.\u2019s Indo-Pacific strategy and the newly announced Australia-U.K.-U.S. (AUKUS) alliance, both sides are also expected to focus on the situation in Afghanistan, amidst the perception in Delhi that the British government had played a major role in talks with the Taliban that led to them taking control of the country.  The visits, beginning October 22, are also being scheduled ahead of the upcoming Climate Change COP26 summit opening in Glasgow on October 31-November 1. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is likely to visit Italy for the G-20 summit on October 30-31, is yet to decide on his plans for COP26, said officials.  Gen. Carter is expected to meet CDS Gen. Bipin Rawat and the three service chiefs. He is also likely to call on NSA Ajit Doval, who as The Hindu had earlier reported, is planning to host a regional conference on Afghanistan in November, and invitations have gone out to several countries including China and Pakistan for it.  New Delhi has been seeking space on events in Afghanistan, given the Taliban control and close links to Pakistan, and discussions with the British military leadership will focus on countering the regional terror threat and terrorism emanating from Afghanistan.  Gen. Carter raised eyebrows in Delhi for comments he made in an interview on August 18, just days after the Taliban takeover of Kabul, where he called the militant group \u201ccountry boys\u201d. He claimed that the Taliban would recognise the need for an inclusive government, and would allow women to work, particularly in the fields of education, health and government. He later said not just he but \u201ceverybody had got it wrong\u201d on Afghanistan.  The comments \u2014 and his frequent meetings in Kabul, Islamabad and Doha in the last few months \u2014 had been noted by South Block, and Mr. Doval and Foreign Secretary Harsh Shringla are understood to have raised them with the U.K. officials.  In addition to the role in the AUKUS alliance that will enable a fleet of nuclear propelled submarines for the Australian navy, a strategy paper for the Indo-Pacific will also be discussed in Gen. Carter\u2019s meetings with officials, and a roundtable with strategic thinkers. In a sign of the U.K.\u2019s focus shift towards maritime security, Gen. Carter, who will retire at the end of November, is set to be succeeded by Naval chief Admiral Tony Radakin as the Chief of Defence Staff.  Ms. Truss, who has taken over as the Foreign Secretary in September, was in India in February in her previous role as Trade Secretary. India and the U.K. have announced a plan to launch negotiations for Free Trade Agreement (FTA) by November 1 and sign an \u201cearly harvest agreement\u201d on high priority goods and services by March, and Ms. Truss is likely to discuss progress towards the deadlines amongst a wide brief of talks on strategic and economic issues, as well as post-COVID recovery. Ms. Truss had met EAM S. Jaishankar on the sidelines of the UNGA in September, and spoke with him earlier this month after the U.K. decided to revise its COVID travel rules, and accept Covishield vaccinated Indians without quarantines in the face of a strong protest from India.

However, as far as wildlife observation and study are concerned, I have found that having no company whatsoever is advisable. Experience has taught me that one of the distinct advantages of going for a walk alone through Munnar\u2019s tea fields is that one can spy upon wildlife unseen and unhindered \u2014 a favourite pastime of mine that has over the years proved to be quite educative nature-wise and enriched my knowledge of wildlife. When one has company, there\u2019s inevitably chatter that makes the timider species of wildlife flee. And, more importantly, one\u2019s concentration is seldom focussed. One evening a few years back while sauntering solo through a tea field, I espied a leopard cat padding along softly on the grassy path some 50 feet below me. Hoping to get a closer view of it, on an impulse I went down on all fours and began to follow it stealthily. I soon found that it was after a Malabar Whistling Thrush foraging and hopping along well ahead of it. In fact, the feline was so intently stalking the bird that it didn\u2019t realise it was itself being stalked! Once, when it had crept close enough, the predator crouched low as if about to pounce, then changed its mind and froze rock-like, all the time keeping its gaze glued on its prey. Inching forward, I managed to get within about 20 feet of it, using the cover of the tea bushes flanking the sinuous path. Then an unseen dry twig snapped crisply under my knee. The leopard cat spun round, its feral eyes widening in seeming disbelief on finding me so close. Then in a split second it was gone, having leapt agilely into the protective cover of the tea bushes. The leopard cat (\u2018Prionailurus bengalensis\u2019) derives its name from its leopard-like colouring though it\u2019s only a midget compared to its better-known lookalike. Indeed it\u2019s more likely to pass for a leopard\u2019s young cub. A forest and plantation-dweller, it\u2019s found across India and Southeast Asia. It has a yellowish brown coat heavily marked with dark spots and streaks and measures from 45 to 75 cm in length excluding its 25-35 cm tail. It\u2019s about the size of a domestic cat but is slenderer and has longer legs. Sharing a common trait with the tiger, it\u2019s believed to use its scat and urine to mark its territory. \u00a0\n The leopard cat is basically a crepuscular and nocturnal hunter that\u2019s also known to prey on domestic fowl which it finds far easier to kill than the elusive jungle fowl. This has led to its being regarded as a pest and killed by poultry farmers in retaliation.    The leopard cat is basically a crepuscular and nocturnal hunter that\u2019s also known to prey on domestic fowl which it finds far easier to kill than the elusive jungle fowl. This has led to its being regarded as a pest and killed by poultry farmers in retaliation.  An agile climber, the leopard cat is arboreal in its habits to a certain extent. It rests in trees (and sometimes hunts from them, stealthily ambushing unwary prey passing below) but also seeks shelter in dense thorny undergrowth on the ground. One evening I espied one ensconced in a silver oak tree in a tea field. It was apparently keeping track of jungle fowl feeding below among the tea bushes \u2014 I could hear the rustling sound created by the fowl \u2018raking\u2019 the ground for grubs with their feet. On seeing me, the feline froze, then clambered higher up the tree and concealed itself amidst the dense foliage. Having satisfied my curiosity and not wanting to be a hindrance to its dinner, I quietly moved on, taking care not to disturb the unsuspecting jungle fowl. The leopard cat is, of course, carnivorous, living off a variety of small prey including mammals, lizards, amphibians and birds. Rats and mice form a major part of its diet. A skilled hunter, it dispatches its prey with a swift pounce and bite that more often than not immobilises it. Unlike the domestic cat, the leopard cat doesn\u2019t \u2018play\u2019 or \u2018toy\u2019 with its prey; it pins it down with its claws until it\u2019s dead. It is believed that this could be due to the relatively high proportion of birds in its diet, which are more likely to escape when released than are rodents. The leopard cat is basically a crepuscular and nocturnal hunter that\u2019s also known to prey on domestic fowl which it finds far easier to kill than the elusive jungle fowl. This has led to its being regarded as a pest and killed by poultry farmers in retaliation. The leopard cat is known to breed in spring. The gestation period extends to about 60-70 days with a litter consisting of between 2 and 4 young that are usually born in a hollow tree trunk, rocky crevice or burrow. The feline has been known to breed and live up to 13 years in captivity. I once came across the mangled pelt of a leopard cat in a British planter\u2019s bungalow in Munnar. He had an intriguing story to tell. The feline had strayed into his garden and had been promptly chased and treed by his vigilant Labrador. Just when the intruder thought it was safely out of the dog\u2019s reach, two tom-cats from a workers\u2019 colony nearby zeroed in on it. A fierce and high-pitched brawl followed, leaving the leopard cat fatally mauled. Perhaps it could\u2019ve successfully taken on one assailant, the planter opined, but two proved too much for it. Having witnessed the entire gory drama, he had retrieved the carcass and tried out his amateurish taxidermy skills on it. Since the leopard cat is believed to be widely distributed across India and Southeast Asia, the IUCN has categorised its conservation status as being of \u2018Least Concern\u2019. However, progressive habitat loss and poaching do pose a threat to the feline in certain parts of India as well as other countries. Commercial trade in its fur and meat had taken a heavy toll of its population earlier, with mainly China and Japan having been involved. Commercial exploitation of its fur has been particularly heavy in China. Between 1955 and 1981, the average number of furs exported per year is believed to be as high as 1,50,000. China officially halted the export of leopard cat furs in 1993. However, the leopard cat is still feared to be commercially exploited for its fur and flesh. The commercial fur trade sees Japan \u2014 the major consumer of its fur in Asia \u2014 import as many as 50,000 skins per year. And now a new dimension has been added to the leopard cat\u2019s woes: its increasing popularity as a pet has apparently led to a clandestine but prospering pet trade (which relies largely on trapping) with suspected international ramifications. Further, in an attempt to produce a new strain of domestic pet, it is believed that experiments are being illegally undPPertaken to cross-breed the leopard cat with its domestic counterpart. Inevitably, in due course this will result in erosion of the former\u2019s bloodline and distinct identity. One can only hope that a cat\u2019s fabled nine lives will save this cuddlesome and furry wild feline from being wiped out altogether. On a more realistic plane, however, we need to learn to value and cherish the rich (but fast dwindling) biodiversity that planet earth harbours \u2014 before it\u2019s too late.

The Indian readout from the talks said clearly that the situation had been caused by China\u2019s attempts to alter the status quo, that China should take appropriate steps to restore peace at the LAC. It also said that Chinese side was not agreeable to India\u2019s constructive suggests and also could not provide any forward-looking proposals. \u201cThe meeting thus did not result in resolution of the remaining areas.\u201d  The Chinese government statement, accompanied by tough rhetoric from state-aligned media said that India had made \u201cunreasonable and unrealistic demands\u201d. 1. The language of official statements during the 13 rounds so far is clearly stronger and more accusatory than in the past. And unlike previous statements, it does not speak about continuing dialogue, simply saying they will maintain communication. 2. Unlike the 12th round, which saw a joint statement being issued, the 13th round has separate unreconciled statements. 3. The commander talks followed the second meeting between Foreign Ministers at Dushanbe\u2026 and the stated failure reflects on a failure of high level communication as well. 4. The 13th round came amidst reports of more flashpoints with Beijing: - a clash at Arunachal Pradesh\u2019s Tawang, that resulted in Indian forces taking Chinese soldiers captive before releasing them. - and a bridge in Uttarakhand\u2019s Barahoti, where Chinese soldiers came in and broke up infrastructure built before leaving. - India rejected China\u2019s objections to a visit by Vice president Venkaiah Naidu to Arunachal Pradesh, asserting its was an integral and inalienable part of India to China\u2019s contention that it was a disputed area. 5. Since the Chinese military build-up was first reported in Delhi in mid-April 2020, talks between the two sides have resulted in some disengagement- primarily at Pangong lake, Galwan valley and Gogra, with buffer zones being set up at some points. This time they were discussing the contentious and strategically critical Patrolling Point 15- PP15 at Hotsprings, and the lack of movement here could hold up the whole disengagement process. Unless another round is concluded differently, the failure of the 13th round means Armies on both sides will spend the second consecutive winter in freezing difficult conditions at the LAC. 1. The failure of talks means the failure of India to convince Chinese troops to revert to old positions from newly occupied positions in a diplomatic manner. It is necessary that this is stated clearly. 2. In a very difficult manoeuvre, claimed as major leverage gain by the Army at the time, Indian troops had managed to claim heights in the Kailash ranges including Rezang La and Rechin La south of Pangong lake last August- the government must explain why India agreed to withdraw those troops during the initial rounds of talks in February on disengagement, giving away this leverage at the beginning of the process rather than waiting for China to show good faith on other areas. 3. Prior to the Chinese incursions, PM Modi had held 18 rounds of talks with Chinese President Xi, including two informal summits lasting hours and hours- the government has yet to explain what sort of understanding they shared on the LAC and resolving boundary issues. 4. The military and government have consistently stated facts that they have later recanted and denied stories later confirmed. For eg: -In mid-May 2020, military and political leadership said the Chinese aggression at the LAC, including two violent clashes was not unusual and resulted from\u00a0 \u201cdifferences in perception of the Line of Actual Control\u201d. However 18 months later it is clear that China has occupied large tracts of land, installed infrastructure that is far from normal. -In June 2020, defence officials were quoted widely saying that Chinese troops had vacated PP 15 at Hotsprings and were clearing PP 17a or Gogra post. Yet Gogra post disengagement only took place after the 12th round of commander talks in August 2021. 5. To date\u2026the statement of PM Modi on June 19 2020, days after the Galwan killings, where he said Nobody has entered Indian territory has not been updated. EAM Jaishankar has said that China has amassed troops on its side of the LAC, but not explained why this alone has merited 13 rounds of talks. Remember, there is an international context to the situation at the LAC, and the reason India\u2019s actions are watched closely: 1. Growing US-China tensions, that appear to want India to commit more clearly to one side. This will also be watched on China-Taiwan tensions, where India has declined to comment on the Chinese decision to send nearly 150 planes over Taiwan\u2019s ADIZ. 2. There is the increasing militarisation of the\u00a0 Indo-Pacific, where China is increasing bases, and sending its blue water navy to new ports in the Indian Ocean region. On the other side, the US has alliances, as its newly announced AUKUS grouping to ensure more nuclear propelled agile and hard to detect submarines at Australia\u2019s command. Any spark on India\u2019s continental front will make India\u2019s moves on the maritime front more strained. 3. Afghanistan, where the Taliban is still in a strong position to rule 2 months after ousting the Ghani government, and India faces a new threat alongside growing violence in Kashmir, the unpredictable LoC, and the now active LAC. 1.

First, it was a clear message to the group of 23 (G-23) leaders \u2014 the group that is seeking internal reforms and a \u201cvisible and effective leadership\u201d \u2014 that she is still the boss. Second, and more importantly, it was meant to convey her endorsement of some of the recent decisions taken by the party that had clear imprints of Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. Whether it was the elevation of Navjot Singh Sidhu as the Punjab Congress chief or unseating of Amarinder Singh as Punjab Chief Minister or the induction of former JNU Students Union president Kanhaiya Kumar, several decisions, that are believed to be driven by the Gandhi siblings, have come under scrutiny.

So, we don\u2019t know who is taking these decisions\u201d \u2014 senior G-23 leader Kapil Sibal\u2019s comments at a press conference had thrown an open challenge to the Gandhis. Ms. Gandhi\u2019s sharp rebuttal at the Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting on October 16 seems to have had the desired effect.  Inside the CWC, G-23 leaders Ghulam Nabi Azad and Anand Sharma reiterated their faith in her leadership and were satisfied with the concession of holding the organisational elections (a key G-23 demand); at a press conference outside, general secretary (organisation) K.C. Venugopal took on journalists who had asked in what capacity Mr. Gandhi was trying to resolve the leadership crises in Congress-ruled Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Punjab. \u201cWe will take decisions as per our party interests. The entire Congress, its rank and file, support Shri Rahul Gandhi for his commitment and dedication to fight on principles. I want to tell you one more thing. Every single decision of the party is taken by honourable Congress president, Smt. Sonia Gandhi. She is competent, capable and nobody can question her leadership,\u201d he told reporters on Saturday. Also read: Diabolical designs on farmers: Congress Working Committee Ms. Gandhi\u2019s statement at the CWC sought to formalise the informal arrangement: Mr. Gandhi would be central to decision making whether or not he enjoys any formal position.  In fact, on Saturday evening, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, who had been delaying if not avoiding an expansion of his Cabinet to accommodate supporters of arch rival Sachin Pilot, called on Mr. Gandhi to discuss the issue.  Before this, on Thursday, Mr. Sidhu had met Mr. Gandhi to iron out his differences with Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi.  And in Chhattisgarh, the former Congress chief is already playing the role of an umpire between Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel and Health Minister T.S. Singh Deo in their leadership tussle.   But beyond the immediate context, by deciding to elect a new party chief only by September 20 next year, the Congress and Ms. Gandhi seem to be preparing the ground for Mr. Gandhi\u2019s eventual elevation ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. In the next 11 months, Mr. Gandhi will have enough time and space to take the party in a direction that he thinks is best suited to take on the Narendra Modi government.

Turkish troops have penetrated deep into Iraq and Syria. Turkish officers are advising the Islamist faction in Libya and supporting it with mercenaries from Syrian militia. Turkey\u2019s navy has become an aggressive presence in the East Mediterranean and is asserting control over gas reserves that Greece and Cyprus claim as their own. Turkey is also a military player in the south Caucasus; last year, it supported Azerbaijan against its arch-rival, Armenia, and secured a victory for its prot\u00e9g\u00e9 that gave it a large part of the territory it claimed from its neighbour. And, as the modern-day sultan claims the Islamic heritage of the Ottomans, he has been confronting till recently the opponents of political Islam in the region \u2014 Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates.  \n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nTurkish President Erdogan again makes reference to Kashmir in UNGA address\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \nTurkish President Erdogan again makes reference to Kashmir in UNGA address\n These robust initiatives have created concerns among regional players \u2014 the Ottomans\u2019 traditional rivals, Iran and Russia, and the contemporary superpower, the United States. With them, Turkey is engaged in complex brinkmanship, in turn confrontationist and accommodative, that imparts tension and uncertainty to these important relationships. Turkey\u2019s military forays into Syria and Iraq have a contemporary urgency \u2014 the aspirations of the Kurds for autonomy, if not independence. In Iraq, Turkey regularly pounds the Turkish Kurds who have taken sanctuary in the Iraqi mountains, with its air force and carries out targeted killings of local commanders with its lethal drones. In Syria, the contiguity of territories under Kurdish control has been broken by Turkey\u2019s three military incursions since 2016 and most of the Syrian-Turkish border is now under Turkish control.  \n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nOIC asks India to reverse decision of scrapping special status of J&K\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \nOIC asks India to reverse decision of scrapping special status of J&K\n Turkey is also involved in a complex charade at Idlib, the last bastion in Syria in rebel hands. Here, it is trying to get the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the former al Qaeda-affiliated Jabhat Nusra, to merge with the Syrian National Army, a coalition of rebel forces it has put together. Turkey believes that, with the formidable HTS on its side, it will be able to contain Kurdish aspirations in northern Syria with local militia. Beyond West Asia, two hotspots have emerged \u2014 again in old Ottoman territory. Having obtained control over the Nakhchivan enclave in the west of Armenia, Azerbaijan now demands control over the passageway, called the Zangezur corridor, that would link Azerbaijan with the enclave. This corridor, if conceded, would cut off Iran\u2019s direct link with Armenia, which is Iran\u2019s sole land route to the northern Caucasus, while giving Turkey a direct route to Azerbaijan and the Central Asian republics, bypassing Iran. This issue has divided the region \u2014 Turkey has put together a tripartite security alliance of itself, Georgia and Azerbaijan, while Iran has affirmed its ties with Armenia and has carried out military exercises at the Azerbaijan border. Also read | Defying Turkey, Joe Biden recognises Armenian genocide   Again, Turkey is highlighting its ties with Georgia and Ukraine, rejecting Russia\u2019s \u201cillegal occupation\u201d of the Crimea and providing Ukraine with military drones. From June this year, it has begun the construction of \u201cCanal Istanbul\u201d, a new link from the Black Sea to the Sea of Marmara, raising concerns in Russia that Turkey might someday restrict free movement between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. In the Mediterranean, Greece and Cyprus have been central to France\u2019s outreach to Africa. This is now challenged by Turkey\u2019s robust outreach to African countries and its plans to obtain a naval presence on the Libyan coast and in the Red Sea. Now, following the AUKUS humiliation \u2014 the trilateral security pact between Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States \u2014 France has concluded a new defence agreement with Greece to upgrade the Greek navy to challenge Turkey in the Mediterranean; it is also supplying fighter jets to the air force, but this deal was signed earlier in January 2021. Both Russia and the U.S. have been watching Turkey\u2019s regional shenanigans with grim concern. Turkey has been alarmed by the U.S.\u2019s backing for the Syrian Kurds and is suspicious of a possible U.S. role in the attempted coup in July 2016 to overthrow Mr. Erdo\u011fan. Violating its status as a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member, Turkey purchased the Russian S-400 missile defence system in 2017. The U.S. then expelled Turkey from the development of America\u2019s F-35 jet fighter project and imposed some sanctions. \n\n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018Dirili\u015f: Ertu\u011frul\u2019 is more than just a Turkish delight\n\n\n\n\n \n\u2018Dirili\u015f: Ertu\u011frul\u2019 is more than just a Turkish delight\n While Mr. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s personal relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin have flourished, there have been regular downturns as well. Turkey and Russia are on opposite sides in Syria, Libya, Ukraine and in the Azerbaijan-Armenia conflict, but have somehow ensured that these differences do not reach breaking-point. Mr. Putin prioritises detaching Turkey from NATO and has adopted \u2018strategic patience\u2019 in dealing with the prickly Turkish leader. Recently, in an attempt to ingratiate himself with U.S. President Joe Biden, Mr. Erdo\u011fan has quite unexpectedly asked the U.S. to supply 40 F-16 fighter jets and 80 modernisation kits for its existing aircraft. But observers believe this could be Mr. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s \u201clast test of confidence\u201d for the Biden administration. Knowing well the hostility directed at Turkey in the U.S. Congress, the expected rejection of this request will enable Mr. Erdo\u011fan to shift irrevocably to Russia \u2014 Mr. Putin has already promised him Russia\u2019s fifth-generation Sukhoi Su-57 aircraft in place of the F-35 jet and even a second battery of the S-400 defence system. As the U.S. disengages from the region, West Asia is experiencing a churn. Saudi Arabia and Iran, whose rivalry has defined regional politics for over a decade, are now talking about re-establishing diplomatic ties and addressing their bilateral and regional concerns. Turkey has reached out to both Egypt and Saudi Arabia to improve their relations; the latter are holding back to see evidence of real change on the Turkish side \u2014 particularly in regard to its support for the Muslim Brotherhood. Turkey has also signalled a new approach in Libya that would accommodate its rivals \u2014 Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Russia. Here, Turkish priority is to detach Egypt from its ties with Greece, Cyprus and Israel, and make it its own ally in the ongoing competition in the Mediterranean.  \n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nTurkey pulls out of landmark treaty protecting women from violence\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \nTurkey pulls out of landmark treaty protecting women from violence\n With Iran, Turkey is pursuing a dual-track approach \u2014 confronting it in the Caucasus, while building substantial bilateral energy and economic ties. It is also keeping open the option of closer strategic relations in case Egypt and Saudi Arabia remain lukewarm to Turkey\u2019s overtures. The outlook for Turkey\u2019s ties with the big powers \u2014 the U.S. and Russia \u2014 remains uncertain. Turkey insists on asserting its strategic autonomy and independence of action, and enjoys sitting at the global high table, its counsel being respectfully solicited by both powers \u2014 as it was in the heyday of the Ottoman empire. But what Turkey could soon discover is that the era of the sultans is over and its domestic divisions and economic fragility \u2014 unemployment, inflation, currency collapse, and capital flight \u2014 will finally determine its regional influence.

the college student Lal, played by Mohanlal, tells the free-spirited poet Siddhan Aashan, played by Nedumudi Venu: \u201cIf Aashan leaves from here, my beat would become like that of a dead body. I want that other beat, the rhythm of life.\u201d The scene leads into Aashan's rendition of \u2018Athiru Kaakkum Malayonnu Thuduthe\u2019 in Nedumudi's own folksy voice. Also Read | Get \u2018First Day First Show\u2019, our weekly newsletter from the world of cinema, in your inbox. You can subscribe for free here That scene perhaps gives a hint of what Nedumudi Venu was to Malayalam cinema, someone with deep links to its cultural ethos, its traditional art forms and literature, someone who imbibed the rhythm of life in Kerala's rice bowl Kuttanad and brought that sense of rhythm into his performances, which ranged from absurdly comical to deeply moving. The actor, who passed away at the age of 73 on Monday, was someone who often managed to break the boundaries of the classification of 'character actor', under which he was bracketed in. There is not one quintessential Nedumudi Venu role, for, in his heydays, he was unrecognisable from one role to the next \u2014 a lecherous, petty thief in one and a kind priest or musician in another. Born as the youngest of five sons of P.K. Kesavan Pillai and Kunjikutti Amma in Alappuzha district's Nedumudi, a backwater village that would later be more known after him rather than the other way around, Venu took to acting quite early in his life, scripting and acting in plays during his school days at the NSS School in Nedumudi and St. Mary's Higher Secondary School in Champakkulam. During his days at S.D. College in Alappuzha, he teamed up with his classmate and filmmaker Fazil for dramas and mimicry performances. One of those performances brought him in touch with Kavalam Narayana Panicker, in whose troupe he became a member, acting in landmark plays, including Avanavan Kadamba and Deivathar. For daily survival, he took up a part-time teaching job as well as journalism, writing stories on some of the lesser known folk artistes and on those in the lower rungs of the film world. His film debut came in G. Aravindan's Thambu in 1978. He perhaps showed the first signs of his brilliance a year later, as Chellappanshari in Padmarajan's Thakara. The kind of roles he received also has to do with the time he came into Malayalam cinema. The Malayalam middle cinema was just taking off, with Venu becoming a regular presence in the films of K.G. George, Padmarajan and Bharathan. Yet, at the same time, he remained an unavoidable component for mainstream Malayalam cinema too. He began playing characters way beyond his age quite early in his career. Padmarajan cast him in the role of a middle-aged tailor in Oridathoru Fayalvan in 1981 after seeing his performance as the old Kaalan Kaniyan in the play Deivathar. Venu was only around 30 at that time. Three years later, he played a rather naughty retired man in Priyadarshan\u2019s Odaruthammava Aalariyam and a scheming old politician in K.G. Goerge\u2019s Panchavadippalam. One of his most memorable roles came in 1981, as the eponymous thief in Padmarajan's Kallan Pavithran. The supporting role as Udaya Varma Thampuran in His Highness Abdullah in 1990 fetched him a national award. That year also witnessed Bharatham, one of the highest points of his career where he played a Carnatic vocalist who slowly loses his music to his drinking habit. Both these films as well as Chithram in 1988 had him sharing the spotlight with Mohanlal, and holding his own. The chemistry he shared with Mohanlal was also quite evident in films such as Orkkappurath and Thenmavin Kombathu. In later years, he was seen more in the role of elder patriarch of the family, almost getting typecast in it. But, he did continue to spring surprises, like he did in the 'Rani' segment in Aanum Pennum earlier this year, which had him a short but impactful role as a crooked old man. He also essayed notable roles in Tamil films, including S. Shankar\u2019s Indian and Anniyan. Nedumudi Venu also wrote films, including Angane Oru Avadhikkalath, Kaattathe Kilikkoodu, Savidham, Theertham, Shruthi and Ambada Njaane!. He won five State film awards. He was also an accomplished percussionist who was equally good at Mridangam, Ghatam and Idakka, and a singer, with his renderings of poems and folk songs having a popular following, be it 'Athiru Kakkum', \u2018Verumoru Moshtavaya\u2019, \u2018Aalayal Thara Venam\u2019 and the song 'Iru Thala Pakshi' with singer Job Kurian. His grounding in music lent his acting performances in song videos that extra touch of authenticity, be it singing \u2018Aandolanam\u2019 in Sargam or playing the Mridangam in the song \u2018Swamintha Paripalaya\u2019 in Chithram. Nedumudi Venu was perhaps one of the last among a bunch of actors, including Thilakan, Bharat Gopi and Oduvil Unnikrishnan, who were the mainstay of Malayalam cinema in the 1980s and 90s, with a wide array of unforgettable character roles. Like each one of them, Nedumudi Venu is irreplaceable.

But it hardly evokes any curiosity among the locals as they know that its just another foreign trip for the globetrotting tea-seller couple who has visited 25 foreign countries across six continents in the past 14 years. \"We will be visiting Moscow and St. Petersburg in the week-long visit. Russia is a country that always fascinated me right from the Soviet Union era. It's the land of the bloody October Revolution and of people who suffered not just at the hands of occupants but that of their own rulers,\" said Mr. Vijayan. The trip would have happened last year if not for the pandemic. The couple took bank loans to fund their initial trips and repaid it from what little they could save from their coffee shop. They run the shop alone and leave for themselves the daily wages, which they would have had to pay had they engaged others. But as the number of trips increased so did the loan, which last year stood at around \u20b94 lakh. However, as their fame spread, they started getting sponsors to the point that they now need not have to pay for their trips any longer. Their last trip to Australia and New Zealand was sponsored and so as their latest trip to Russia, which is being funded by a travel agency. Unlike their past trips, this time they will be accompanied by their two daughters and their families who, however, will have to fund the trip on their own. \"It would take around \u20b913.50 lakh, which they would raise by taking loan from their Provident Fund or pawning their ornaments,\" said 71-year-old Mr. Vijayan who treat life as countless journeys strung together. He also has a trip to Singapore lined up to inaugurate the office of a travel agency of which he is the brand ambassador, a role for which he is also being paid. Japan is where he wants to head next followed by Vietnam and Cambodia with his 69-year-old wife Ms. Mohana who is as enthusiastic about travelling. Such as been their vast experience travelling around the world that the couple brought out a book last year, Chaaya Vittu Vijayanteyum Mohanayudeyum Loka Sancharangal, which when loosely translated reads as the global tours of Mr. Vijayan and Ms. Mohana by selling tea.

The fourth straight day of 35 paise per litre hike sent petrol and diesel rates to record highs across the country.

In Mumbai, diesel now comes for \u20b9102.52 a litre; while in Delhi, it costs \u20b994.57.  With this rise, petrol is now at \u20b9100-a-litre mark or more in all State capitals while diesel has touched the 100-mark in over a dozen states. Diesel crossed the \u20b9100-a-litre mark in Bengaluru, Daman and Silvassa.  Petrol used in two-wheelers and cars now costs 33% more than the price at which aviation turbine fuel (ATF) is sold to airlines. ATF in Delhi costs \u20b979,020.16 per kilolitre or \u20b979 per litre.  The costliest fuel is in the border town of Ganganagar in Rajasthan where petrol comes for \u20b9117.86 a litre and diesel for \u20b9105.95.  Since ending of a three-week long hiatus in rate revision in the last week of September, this is the 16th increase in petrol price and the 19th time that diesel rates have gone up.  While petrol price in most of the country is already above \u20b9100-a-litre mark, diesel rates have crossed that level in over a dozen States/UT including Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Chattisgarh, Bihar, Kerala, Karnataka and Ladakh.  Prices differ from state to state depending on the incidence of local taxes.  Shedding the modest price change policy, state-owned fuel retailers have since October 6 started passing on the larger incidence of cost to consumers.  This is because the international benchmark Brent crude is trading at $84.8 per barrel for the first time in seven years.  A month back, Brent was trading at $73.51.  Being a net importer of oil, India prices petrol and diesel at rates equivalent to international prices.  The surge in international oil prices ended a three-week hiatus in rates on September 28 for petrol and September 24 for diesel.  Since then, diesel rates have gone up by \u20b95.95 per litre and petrol price has increased by \u20b94.65.  Prior to that, the petrol price was increased by \u20b911.44 a litre between May 4 and July 17. Diesel rate had gone up by \u20b99.14 during this period.

The ISA was jointly launched by India and France in 2015 at the 21st Conference of Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP21) held in Paris. \u201cIt is my honour to introduce the draft resolution...for granting Observer Status for the International Solar Alliance on behalf of India and France\u201d and about 80 co-sponsors, India\u2019s Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador T.S. Tirumurti said on Friday. \u201cThe International Solar Alliance through its efforts to bring about just and equitable energy solutions through the deployment of solar energy is expected to usher in a new era of green energy diplomacy,\u201d Mr. Tirumurti said in the General Assembly as he introduced the draft resolution in the Sixth Committee of the General Assembly that deals with legal questions.  The granting of Observer Status to the ISA in the General Assembly would help provide for a regular and well-defined cooperation between the Alliance and the United Nations that would benefit global energy growth and development, he said.  The co-sponsors include Algeria, Australia, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Canada, Chile, Cuba, Denmark, Egypt, Fiji, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Maldives, Mauritius, Myanmar, New Zealand, Oman, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Saudi Arabia, Trinidad and Tobago, United Arab Emirates and United Kingdom.  \"Another milestone for (the) International Solar Alliance. India introduces draft resolution in #UNGA for granting Observer Status to @isolaralliance (ISA). I said that ISA, through its efforts towards just & equitable energy solutions, will usher in (a) new era of \u201cGreen Energy Diplomacy\u201d,\" Mr. Tirumurti tweeted.  He underlined that granting the ISA observer status in UNGA would enable the organisation to provide targeted inputs to current and future United Nations processes, based on grass-root level experiences from its country programmes, its research and public-private cooperation activities and its global knowledge-sharing activities. The ISA is also taking a big step towards addressing some of the questions like \u201ctechnological transfer\u201d, \u201cstorage of solar energy\u201d and even financial assistance to member countries, along with project layout and project planning, Mr. Tirumurti said.  The United Nations General Assembly may grant Permanent Observer Status to non-member states, international organisations and other entities.  As per information on the UN website, the General Assembly decided that \u201cobserver status would be confined to states and intergovernmental organisations whose activities cover matters of interest to the Assembly\u201d. The Sixth Committee of the General Assembly considers all applications for observer status before they are considered in the plenary session. The Permanent Observers may participate in the sessions and workings of the General Assembly and maintain missions at the U.N. headquarters, the website said.  Intergovernmental Organisations having received a standing invitation to participate as Observers in the sessions and the work of the UNGA include European Union, INTERPOL, International Renewable Energy Agency, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Asian Development Bank, Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Commonwealth of Independent States, European Organisation for Nuclear Research, Indian Ocean Rim Association, Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, International Committee of the Red Cross and International Olympic Committee.  Mr. Tirumurti stressed that the Framework Agreement of the ISA explicitly designates the U.N., including its organs, as strategic partners of the Alliance. \u201cObserver status will greatly enhance the Alliance\u2019s ability to achieve its goals,\u201d he said, adding that the ISA will be able to follow closely the deliberations in the General Assembly, cooperate with the U.N. organs, agencies and programmes in implementation of its programmes and activities and benefit from the U.N. network of field offices, its experience in programme cooperation with governments and its wide resources in the development process.  The International Solar Alliance was opened for signature as an international treaty-based organisation in November 2016 and the agreement entered into force on December 6, 2017. Mr. Tirumurti said the Alliance of solar-resource rich countries with its membership was open to those 121 U.N. member states that lie fully or partially between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. This was further amended at the First Assembly of the ISA, to expand the scope of the ISA membership to all U.N. member states.  He said the Paris Declaration on the launch of the ISA expounded the shared vision of bringing clean, affordable, and renewable energy within reach of all.  Noting that the ISA is dedicated to contributing to the successful outcome of the U.N. process on sustainable development and the attainment of internationally agreed development goals, Mr. Tirumurti said, \u201cWe seek your support for the draft resolution.\u201d  \u201cSince its establishment, (the) International Solar Alliance has strived to achieve its objectives by initiating thematic programmes dedicated to the deployment of cross-cutting solar energy applications across multiple sectors including, but not limited to, agriculture, health, and electricity. ISA has played an important role internationally in supporting the implementation of United Nations Framework Conventions on Climate Change and the global climate agenda in general,\u201d he said. Mr. Tirumurti added that participation in major international meetings involving these issues is often critical for the ISA to carry out its work and mandate.

The Index launched on Thursday ranked India at 101 position of 116 countries. India is also among the 31 countries where hunger has been identified as serious. India ranked 94 among 107 countries in the Global Hunger Index (GHI) released last year. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \u201cThe publishing agencies of the Global Hunger Report, Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe have not done their due diligence before releasing the report. The methodology used by FAO is unscientific. They have based their assessment on the results of a \u2018four question\u2019 opinion poll, which was conducted telephonically by Gallup,\u201d the Ministry of Women and Child Development said in a statement. According to the Index, only 15 countries fare worse than India. They are Papua New Guinea (102), Afghanistan and Nigeria (103), Congo (105), Mozambique and Sierra Leone (106), Timor-Leste (108), Haiti (109), Liberia (110), Madagascar (111), Democratic Republic of Congo (112), Chad (113), Central African Republic (114), Yemen (115) and Somalia (116). India was also behind most of the neighbouring countries. Pakistan was placed at 92, Nepal and Bangladesh at 76 and Sri Lanka at 65. The Government has contested the performance of these neighbouring countries on the Index. \u201cIt is noted with surprise, from the FAO report \u2018The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2021\u2019, that other four countries of this region \u2014 Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka \u2014 have not been affected at all by COVID-19 pandemic induced loss of job/business and reduction in income levels, rather they have been able to improve their position on the indicator \u2018proportion of undernourished population\u2019 by 4.3%, 3.3%, 1.3% and 0.8% points respectively during the period 2018-20 over 2017-19,\" the statement adds. The GHI scores are based on the values of four component indicators \u2014 undernourishment, child wasting, child stunting and child mortality. Based on the values of the four indicators, the GHI determines hunger on a 100-point scale, where 0 is the best possible score (no hunger) and 100 is the worst. Each country\u2019s GHI score is classified by severity, from low to extremely alarming. Undernourishment data are provided by the Food and Agriculture Organisation and child mortality data are sourced from the U.N. Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME). Child wasting and stunting data are drawn from the joint database of UNICEF, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank, among others. It is the FAO report used for assessing undernourishment that the Government has questioned. This is also the only indicator in the report that has shown deterioration in India, the other three either show an improvement or have remained unchanged. The Government has questioned the poll-based assessment that \u201chas increased the value of \u2018proportion of population undernourished\u2019 from 14.0% for the previous period 2017-19 to 15.3% for the latest period 2018-20,\u201d according to an official. According to the FAO report, prevalence of undernourishment in a population is calculated in a very scientific manner that includes habitual dietary energy intake levels, information on the population structure and median height in each sex and age.

As tensions boiled over between the two countries following the Galwan Valley clashes last year, India ramped up its overall deployment along the nearly 3,400-km-long LAC besides speeding up infrastructure development to gain a tactical advantage.  The people cited above said a sizeable fleet of Israeli-made Heron medium-altitude long-endurance drones is carrying out round-the-clock surveillance over the LAC in the mountainous terrain and sending crucial data and images to command and control centres.  Along with the drones, the Indian Army\u2019s aviation wing has also been deploying the Weapon System Integrated (WSI) variant of the Advanced Light Helicopter Rudra in the region, adding more teeth to its tactical missions in the region, they said. Also read: The Hindu Explains | Who does Galwan Valley belong to?  In an expansion of its aviation wing in the region, the Army has come out with an independent aviation brigade in the region this year to bolster its overall operational preparedness in the sensitive region, they said.  They said though the Heron drones were first deployed in the region around four-five years back, now the integration of surveillance has been significantly enhanced under the \u2018sensor to shooter\u2019 concept to employ military forces at short notice for any possible operational objectives.  The deployment of the WSI version of the ALH helicopters has also provided the Army an added advantage to carry out various missions in the high-altitude areas.  Asked about the weapons package of the ALH helicopters, they refused to divulge the details but said it is one of the best and would be very effective against the adversary. \u201cOverall, our day and night surveillance capability has seen massive upgrades since last year and we are in a much better position to deal with any eventualities in the region,\u201d said one of the people cited above.  The Indian Army is also procuring a fleet of Heron TP drones on lease from Israel that are capable of operating for nearly 45 hours at an altitude of up to 35,000 feet.  The Heron TP drones are equipped with automatic taxi-takeoff and landing (ATOL) and satellite communication (SATCOM) systems for an extended range.  They said additional roads, bridges and railway infrastructure are being built in the Arunachal sector considering their strategic requirement in the wake of evolving security dynamics in the region. The government is also working on connecting Tawang with a railway network as part of the decision to enhance infrastructure in the region.  The people cited above also said that infrastructure at almost all airfields along the LAC including the Advanced Landing Grounds (ALGs) was enhanced as per operational requirements.  The eastern Ladakh border standoff between the Indian and Chinese militaries erupted on May 5 last year following a violent clash in the Pangong lake areas and both sides gradually enhanced their deployment by rushing in tens of thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry.  The tension escalated following the deadly clashes in Galwan Valley on June 15 last year. As a result of a series of military and diplomatic talks, the two sides completed the disengagement process in the Gogra area in August and in the north and south banks of the Pangong lake in February.  However, the last round of military talks on October 10 ended in a stalemate.  Each side currently has around 50,000 to 60,000 troops along the LAC in the sensitive sector.

It is a matter of great joy for me to wish all Indians, living in India and abroad, a very Happy Independence Day! This day has a special significance as it marks the beginning of the 75th year of India\u2019s independence for which \u2018Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav\u2019 is being celebrated. My hearty congratulations to you all on this momentous occasion! Independence Day is a festival of freedom for us. This was made possible by generations of freedom fighters; some known, many unknown. They made great sacrifices. Today, you and I breathe under free skies thanks to their heroic deeds. I bowin respect to the pious memory of those brave martyrs. Our nation, like many others, suffered great injustices and tyranny under foreign rule.What distinguishes India, however, is that the character of our nationalist movement, led by Mahatma Gandhi, was based on the principles of truth and non-violence. He and all other national heroes provided us with an invaluable blueprint to not only liberate the nation from colonial rule, but also to rebuild it. Gandhiji\u2019s struggle was for a return to Indian ethos and for human dignity. Now as we look back to the seventy five year journey of our republic, we have reasons to be proud of the considerable distance we have travelled. Gandhiji taught us that slow and steady steps in the right direction are preferable to rapid strides in the wrong direction. The world looks up at the miracle of India, home to the plurality of traditions and yet the biggest and most vibrant democracy. Dear Fellow Citizens, In the recently concluded Tokyo Olympics, our sportspersons have brought laurels to the nation with their stellar performances. India has won the highest number of medals in the 121 years of its participation in the Olympics. Our daughters have achieved world class excellence in playgrounds overcoming many adversities. Along with sports, epoch-making changes are taking place in the participation and success of women in all walks of life. From higher educational institutions to armed forces, from laboratories to playgrounds, our daughters are making their mark. In this success of our daughters, I see a glimpse of a developed India of the future. I urge every parent to learn from the families of such promising daughters and provide opportunities to their daughtersalsoto explore avenues of growth. Like last year, this year too, the scale of Independence Day celebration may have been reduced due to pandemic,yet our hearts remain always filled with enthusiasm. The intensity of the pandemic has come down, but the coronavirus has not yet gone away. We are yet to come out of the devastating effects of its recurrence this year. Last year, with exceptional efforts from all, we had succeeded in bringing the spread of infections under control. Our scientists had succeeded in developing vaccines in a very short time. Therefore, at the beginning of this year, there was every reason to be hopeful as we launched the largest vaccination exercise in history. Yet, due to the new variants and other unexpected factors, we suffered from a terrible second wave. I am deeply sad thatmanylives could not be saved and many more suffered immensely in this phase of an unprecedented crisis. I speak for the whole nation when I say that I share the grief of all the affected families with the same intensity. The science is coping with this invisible enemy of terrible might with remarkable speed. We can take solace from the fact that more lives have been saved than the lives lost. It was our collective determination to overcome the challenge that helped us see the weakening of the second wave. Once again, our corona warriors, the doctors, nurses and health workers, the administrators, and others, risked everything to contain the impact of the second wave. The second wave brought our public healthcare infrastructure under stress. The reality is that no infrastructure, even of advanced economies, could withstand a crisis of such enormous proportions. Efforts were made on war-footing to plug the gaps. The leadership rose to the challenge, and the government\u2019s endeavours were supplemented by initiatives of the states, private sector healthcare facilities, the civil society and others. In this extraordinary mission, foreign nations shared the essentials generously, just as India had reached out to many nations with medicine, equipment and vaccines. I am grateful to the global fraternity that came forward with a helping hand. Due to these efforts, the nation breathes a sigh of relief with the return of a semblance of normalcy. If we have learned our lessons well, we know that this is the time of extra care and caution. We shall not let our guard down. Vaccines are the best possible protection science offers to us. Under the world\u2019s biggest vaccination campaign going on in our country, more than 50 crore fellow citizens have been vaccinated so far. I urge all eligible citizens who are yet to get vaccinated to do so at the earliest and also inspire others. Dear Fellow Citizens, The economic impact of the pandemic is as disastrous as its health impact. The government has been concerned about the lower middle classes and the poor, as well as about the small and medium industries. It has been sensitive to the needs of the labourers and of employers who have been facing hardships due to the lockdowns and movement restrictions. Sensitive to their needs, the government had taken a series of relief measures last year. This year also, the government had distributed food grains to about 80 crore people in May and June. This benefit has been extended till Diwali. Moreover, the government has announced a new stimulus package worth Rupees 6 lakh 28 thousand crore to boost the selected Covid-affected sectors. In particular, it is heartening to note that an amount of Rupees 23 thousand 220 crore is being spent over one year for expansion of medical facilities. It is heartening to note that rural India, particularly the agriculture sector has kept growing against all odds. In a recent visit to myancestralvillage Paraunkh in Kanpur Dehat district, I was quite pleased to find that better infrastructure is being developed to make life better for people in rural areas. The psychological distance between the urban and the rural is now much less as compared to the past. After all, India lives in its villages which cannot be allowed to lag behind in development. That is why special campaigns, including the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi, are being implemented for the welfare of our farmers. These efforts are consistent with the vision of an Atma Nirbhar Bharat, a self-reliant India. With abiding faith in the inherent capacity of the economy, the government has further opened up defence,health, civil aviation, power and other sectors. The government\u2019s new initiatives to promote eco-friendly, renewable sources of energy, particularly solar power, have won praise around the world. If there is an improvement in the ease of doing business, ithas a positiveimpact onthe ease of living for all. In addition to these, special emphasis is being given to public welfare. For example, the dream of having a home of one\u2019s own is being realised, thanks to the Rupees 70,000 crore credit-linked subsidy scheme. The series of agricultural marketing reforms will empower our \u2018annadata\u2019 farmers and help them get better price for their produce. These are some of the measures the government has taken to unleash the potential of every Indian. Dear Fellow Citizens, A new dawn is rising in Jammu and Kashmir. The government has initiated the process of consultation with all stakeholders who have faith in democracy and the rule of law. I urge the people, especially the youth, of Jammu and Kashmir to utilise this opportunity and work on realising their aspirations through democratic institutions. With all-round progress, India\u2019s stature is rising in the international arena, as it was reflected in our participation in several key multilateral forums as well as in consolidating bilateral relationships with several countries. Dear Fellow Citizens, When India won Independence 75 years ago, many sceptics thought democracy would not survive in India. Little did they know that roots of democracy were nurtured in this soil in ancient times, and even in modern times India was ahead of many western nations in offering franchise to all adults, regardless of any distinctions. The founding fathers had reposed their faith in the wisdom of the people, and \u2018we, the people of India\u2019 have made India a strong democracy. We have adopted the system of parliamentary democracy. Therefore, our Parliament is the temple of our democracy which provides us highest forum where we discuss, debate and decide issues for the well-being of our people. It is a matter of great pride for all Indians that our Parliament will soon be housed in a new building. It will be a fitting statement of our outlook: It will honour our legacy while also walking in step with the contemporary world. It is more than symbolic that the new building will be inaugurated in the year of the 75th anniversary of Independence. The government has planned many initiatives to make this special year memorable, and the most exciting of them all may as well be the Gaganyaan mission. Pilots of the Indian Air Force have been receiving training abroad. When they fly off into space, India will become only the fourth nation on the planet to carry out a manned space mission. When it comes to the flights of our ambitions, we don\u2019t let any limitations define us. Yet we keep our feet on the ground. We acknowledge that we still have a long way to go in realising the dreams of those who won the freedom for us. Our Constitution neatly summarises those dreams in four words: Justice,Liberty, Equality and Fraternity. We must strive for more equality in an unequal world, more justice in unjust circumstances. Justice has come to encompass a larger range of connotations, including economic and environmental justice. The road ahead is not easy. We will have to negotiate many twists and turns, but we have the benefit of incomparable guidance. It comes to us from diverse sources, from the venerable seers of millennia ago, down to the sages and leaders of more recent times. In the spirit of \u201cunity in diversity\u201d, we as a nation are following the right course. This vision derived from the unique Indian heritage is going to be helpful not only to us but to the whole world in this century. Modern industrial civilization has posed serious challenges before humankind. Climate change has become a reality of life, with seas rising, glaciers melting and temperatures soaring. India is proud of not only adhering to the Paris climate agreement but doing more than what the country has committed to protect the climate. However, the world desperately needs a course correction. This is why the world is increasingly turning to the wisdom of India, as created by the authors of the Vedas and Upanishads, as depicted in the Ramayana and Mahabharata, as taught by Lord Mahavira, Lord Buddha and Guru Nanak and as reflected in the lives of the likes of Mahatma Gandhi. Learning the art of living in tune with nature requires effort, Gandhiji says, but once you establish a relationship with rivers and mountains, birds and animals, nature reveals its secrets to you. Let us resolve to listen to this message of Gandhiji and also to make sacrifices for the sake of the land we live in. The spirit of patriotism and sacrifice was paramount among our freedom fighters. They faced all kinds ofchallenges without caring for their own interests. I have seen that in the face of Corona crisis, lakhs of people have taken enormous risks to protect others, with the spirit of selfless service for humanity. I convey my profound appreciation for all such covid warriors. Many of them succumbed to Covid-19. I pay homage to them. Recently, on the occasion of \u2018Kargil Vijay Diwas\u2019, I wanted to visitthe \u2018Kargil War Memorial - Dras\u2019 in Ladakh to pay homage to our brave soldiers. But due to bad weather, it was not possible for me to reach that monument. On that day, Ipaid homage to our brave soldiers at the \u2018Dagger War Memorial\u2019 in Baramulla. That memorial has been built in the memory of all the soldiers who have made the supreme sacrifice in their line of duty. While appreciating the valour and sacrifice of those brave warriors, I noticed that the war memorial has a motto inscribed: \u201c\u092e\u0947\u0930\u093e \u0939\u0930\u0915\u093e\u092e, \u0926\u0947\u0936 \u0915\u0947 \u0928\u093e\u092e\u201d which means, each and every deed of mineis for the nation. All of us should imbibe this motto as a mantra and work with full devotion and dedication for the development of the nation. I would like that all of us come together to take India forward on the path of progress with the spirit of keeping the interest of the nation and society foremost. Dear Fellow Citizens, I extend my greetings especially to the members of the armed forces, who have guarded our freedom, valiantly and gladly making supreme sacrifice when necessary. I also extend my greetings to the members of the Indian diaspora, who have represented the motherland well wherever they have made home. I once again congratulate all of you, on the eve of India\u2019s 75th Independence Day. While celebrating this anniversary, I cannot stop my mind from imagining a powerful, prosperous and peaceful India of 2047 when we will celebrate 100 years of our independence. I wish that all our people come out of the difficulties caused by the Covid pandemic and move ahead on the path of happiness and prosperity. Once again, my best wishes to all of you! Thank you, Jai Hind!

An organic chemist can plan a blueprint for a new molecule, and synthesize it with precision out of atoms of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen and so on. After centuries of fine-tuning this skill, chemists in the early 20th century moved up to synthesizing long, thread-like one-dimensional polymers. The polyethylene of plastic bags is made from repeating units of the ethylene molecule, (importantly, the units are linked by the same firm chemical bonds as are seen within an organic molecule. This provides the stability that ensures that a shirt made from polyester-mixed yarn is long lasting). In biological systems, proteins are 1-dimensional polymers of amino acids. In recent years, this has been taken to a new level by the creation of extended 2- or 3-dimensional structures from linking together molecular units just as was done for polymers, but in two or three dimensions. The basic units go on fitting together to form large networks, like a wire mesh fence. The network is constructed by repeated additions of a molecule with symmetry. A few such networked sheets, when stacked one over another, form a functional 2-D entity. Because words like polymer do not do justice to this complex arrangement of atoms, such molecular networks are called frameworks.  Uses for these Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) take advantage of their stability, large surface area, controlled pore sizes, and tunable chemical environments. Just as you choose the size of the \u2018pore\u2019/hole in a wire mesh, frameworks can be designed to act as sieves in separating out molecules of a specified size. The smallest whiff of a toxic gas could be sensed - in an industrial environment, or in airline baggage. They are also suitable for both storing energy (as capacitors) and for conducting it (along membranes in fuel cells). Metal Organic frameworks (MOFs) are structured like COFs but have metals in complexes with organic entities. The choice of metals is wide, from Beryllium to Zinc, though relatively abundant metals are preferred for economic and environmental reasons. They offer great advantages: for gas storage, as in the case of hydrogen storage in fuel cells; in catalysis, where they replace very expensive metals; in sensors; and in drug-delivery \u2013 anti-cancer and other drugs with severe side effects can be trapped in the porous confines of MOFs, to be released in small and steady doses. Zeolites are highly porous, 3-D meshes of silica and alumina. In nature, they occur where volcanic outflows have met water. Synthetic zeolites have proven to be a big and low-cost boon. One biomedical device that has entered our lexicon during the pandemic is the oxygen concentrator. This device has brought down the scale of oxygen purification from industrial-size plants to the volumes needed for a single person. At the heart of this technology are synthetic frameworks of silica and alumina with nanometer-size pores that are rigid and inflexible. Beads of one such material, zeolite 13X, about a millimeter in diameter, are packed into two cylindrical columns in an oxygen concentrator.  The chemistry here is tailored to the task of separating oxygen from nitrogen in air. Being highly porous, zeolite beads have a surface area of about 500 square meters per gram. At high pressures in the column, nitrogen is in a tight embrace, chemically speaking, with the zeolite. Interaction between the negatively charged zeolite and the asymmetric nucleus (quadrupole moment) of nitrogen causes it to be preferentially adsorbed on the surface of the zeolite. Oxygen remains free, and is thus enriched. Air has 78% nitrogen, 20.9% oxygen and smaller quantities of argon, carbon dioxide, etc. Once nitrogen is under arrest, what flows out from the column is 90%-plus oxygen. After this, lowering the pressure in the column releases the nitrogen, which is flushed out, and the cycle is repeated with fresh air.  Global volunteer efforts have made available very detailed instructions on building your own oxygen concentrator, with locally available resources. In India, IISc has transferred the technology of making oxygen concentrators to over 20 companies.

He is Burari\u2019s beat officer who reached the house at 7.18 a.m., a few minutes after a PCR (Police Control Room) call was made. He pushed a few people crowding the narrow lane and took the steps leading to the scene of crime. \u201cIt was shocking. I stayed only for 10-15 seconds before rushing downstairs to call my seniors. At the time I did not see whose hands were tied and whose eyes were covered. I just saw a lot of bodies hanging, just like branches of a tree,\u201d Mr. Tomar recalled. On the first floor of the house, the bodies Bhavnesh Singh (50); his brother, Lalit Singh (45); their wives, Savita (48) and Tina (42) respectively; their children, Neetu (25), Monu alias Maneka (23), Dhruv alias Dushyant (15) and Shivam (15); their sister Pratibha alias Baby (48) and her daughter Priyanka (33) were found hanging in a circular formation; Pratibha was hanging a little away from the group. The mother, 77-year-old Narayan Devi, was found dead on the floor in the adjacent room. The deaths, initially suspected to be a case of murder because of tied limbs, blindfolds and gagged mouths, baffled the investigators after they discovered 11 diaries scribbled with notes detailing the situation. Based on the diary entries, the police suspected it to be a case of a ritual gone wrong, leading to what could be called a \u201cmass suicide\u201d. The police said the diaries were dictated by Lalit who believed the \u201cspirit\u201d of his father Bhopal Singh, who died in 2007, was communicating with him and instructing him to perform \u2018badh tapasya [banyan tree worship]\u2019 for the betterment of the family. A question that has perplexed many is how did the family members, including 15 and 25-year-olds, agree to tie a noose around their neck and believe they would survive the alleged ritual? \n\n\n\n\n\nTen bodies were found on the first floor of the house, while the mother was found dead in an adjacent room. \u00a0\n| Photo Credit: Sushil Kumar Verma \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 The Chundawat family, originally from Rajasthan, stayed in Haryana\u2019s Tohana for over a decade before moving to Delhi in 1989-90. Bhopal Singh, the husband of Narayan Devi, was a financially secure man with farmlands and cattle to rear. He sold the land and bought a plot in Burari, where he moved in with his wife and youngest son Lalit. Bhopal Singh\u2019s only surviving son Dinesh Singh Chundawat, a building contractor in Chittorgarh, said he and Bhavnesh did not shift to Delhi at that time because of their roots in Rajasthan. \u201cOur entire family [relatives] was in Rajasthan, in and around Sawa village. We did not want to cut ties. Also, I liked open spaces, something which Delhi did not have. Bhavnesh and his wife came along and we thought we would set up a business together,\u201d he said. Mr. Dinesh spent eight years in Saudi Arabia from 1978-86 as a manager in a sales firm. Visibly irritated over being called a member of the \u201cBhatia family\u201d in news reports, Mr. Dinesh stressed his surname is Chundawat. \u201cWe are all Chundawats. My mother was a Bhatia from Punjab and when they [his parents] stayed there for a few years after their marriage, my father came to be known as Bhatia saab, a title which stayed with him for years,\u201d he said, adding that his sister Pratibha was married to Harinder Bhatia alias Hira, and therefore her and Priyanka\u2019s surname remained Bhatia. Bhopal Singh, fondly called \u2018Daddy\u2019 by everyone close to him, was a man who commanded respect from everyone. \u201cHe would not even shout. His eyes were enough to let us know what we should not do,\u201d Mr. Dinesh recalled. \u201cHe used to drink and eat non-vegetarian food. In fact, he used to cook delicious mutton dishes. But we never drank together. Whenever I visited Delhi, he used to leave a bottle of whiskey in my room for me and Bhavnesh to drink.\u201d Why not Lalit? \u201cOh, he was always a teetotaller,\u201d said Mr. Dinesh. Bhopal Singh and Narayan Devi had earned the affection of their neighbours too. \u201cMummy [Narayan Devi] and Daddy [Bhopal Singh] considered me their daughter. I used to tie rakhi to Bhavnesh and Lalit,\u201d said Rita Sharma (62), a retired government official who lives right opposite the house of the Chundawat family. When her house was being constructed in 1991, Ms. Sharma recalled, \u201cThey [Bhopal Singh and Narayan Devi] used to supervise the workers and even provided them water and tea at regular intervals.\u201d The couple even took care of Ms. Sharma\u2019s one-year-old son Arnav when the Sharmas moved into their house in 1992. \u201cFrom changing Arnav\u2019s nappies to feeding him to making him sleep, they took charge. He practically stayed with them in the initial years,\u201d she said. Ms. Sharma said she never had to make pickle in the last 26 years because \u201cMummy\u201d always had ready stock. In 1993, Bhavnesh, his wife Savita and little Neetu came to Delhi from Rajasthan after Bhopal Singh summoned both his sons home. \u201cI did not go because I met with an accident in 1992 and was on bed for about 12 months. My work in Rajasthan was also prospering,\u201d Mr. Dinesh said. In the mid-1990s, Bhopal Singh\u2019s daughter Pratibha also came to stay with him in Delhi. Ms. Sharma claimed that Pratibha's husband Harinder Bhatia was an alcoholic and his family \u201cdid not treat her well\u201d. \u201cAfter Pratibha\u2019s husband\u2019s death, we did not think she would be happy at his house. Our father told us to bring her back, provide the best education to Priyanka [Pratibha and Harinder\u2019s daughter] and make her a successful individual,\u201d Mr. Dinesh said. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe house where 11 members of the Chundawat family were found dead on the morning of July 1.\n\u00a0\n| Photo Credit: Sushil Kumar Verma \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 Lalit, who is at the centre of the macabre tragedy, was a rather complex character. Called kaka (uncle) by youngsters, he was funny, reserved, responsible, authoritative, all at once. He was also the only earning member when the Chundawat family moved to Delhi. Chander Prakash Mehta, a resident of Tohana and Lalit\u2019s best friend since 1989, recalled that his friend was no stranger to challenges. Both of them studied medicine at a private college in Hisar. \u201cLalit was a year senior in Inter College but he could not take exams in the junior year because he met with an accident. He had to repeat the year. In the senior year, during examinations, he fell ill again. He had to drop out,\u201d said Mr. Mehta. After Lalit moved to Delhi, the two remained close friends, visiting each other regularly. Mr. Mehta remembered sitting for hours into the night with Lalit and talking about their friends from college. \u201cLalit joked a lot. He was probably the funniest in our group. But he was a no-nonsense man and he never compromised on principles.\u201d Lalit started working at a plywood shop in Shahdara in the mid 1990s and around 10 years ago, he opened his own shop in Burari. In February 2002, he got married to Tina. Three years later, their son Shivam was born. In 2004, a major incident shook Lalit\u2019s life. \u201cHe was pushed under several sheets of plywood and set on fire. We knew who did it but the matter was resolved through a compromise,\u201d said Mr. Dinesh. Lalit lost his voice in the incident. Things began to change in Lalit\u2019s life in February 2007 after his father died of respiratory illness. Ms. Sharma said the whole family was devastated and a priest was called for Garuda Purana paath (a prayer) for 10 days after the death. \u201cOne of those 10 days, we were all sitting and listening to the prayers when Lalit suddenly started chanting Om. His voice came back and everybody said \u2018Daddy aa gaye\u2019 [Daddy has returned],\u201d she said. This was perhaps the beginning of the end, said the neighbours. Naresh Yadav, who lives a few houses away and was a regular customer at Lalit\u2019s shop, recalled a conversation with him in 2008. \u201cI asked him how he regained his voice and he said his father came in his dream and asked him to perform a puja,\u201d he said, adding that Lalit never mentioned such dreams about his father again. Ms. Sharma said Lalit and Bhavnesh\u2019s children used to call her for kirtans, which started soon after Bhopal Singh\u2019s death. \u201cEvery night around 9 p.m., they would sit together and pray for 15-30 minutes. The kids used to tell me \u2018Daddy ke aane ka time ho gaya\u2019 [it is time for grandfather to come],\u201d she said. During the kirtans, Lalit used to sit in front. Over the years he had taken the place of Bhopal Singh in the family. The Chundawats also adopted a lot of lifestyle changes. They stopped eating and cooking non-vegetarian food. Bhavnesh stopped drinking at home. The pujas became a regular affair. The number of shops increased from one to three, Lalit\u2019s plywood shop, Bhavnesh\u2019s grocery shop and the third one they were setting up together, so did the floors of the house. The first mention of Bhopal Singh in Lalit\u2019s diaries is made on September 7, 2007, wherein the notes ask the family to keep his black and white photo in front of them and remember him. \u201cMann mein dhyan yahi rakho ki Daddy meri purani aadatein chhut jaye [pray that you get rid of your old habits],\u201d read the September note. The diaries thereon are filled with instructions, in a strict, almost scolding tone, for all the family members to follow. They dictated the daily routine of the members, including their eating habits and other mundane activities, for financial and general betterment of the family. The notes appear to have a major bearing on the way all members of the family lived their lives. Lalit\u2019s employee Ahmed Ali alias Pappu, who had been working with him for the last six years, said the man often brought his father into conversations. \u201cHe would mention uncleji to show how one should be a good person,\u201d Ali said. The week before the incident, Lalit was not going to his shop much. Ali said he was not keeping well and was spending most of the time sleeping at home. Unable to wrap his head around the deaths and the alleged reason behind them, Ali said he always saw his employer as a kind and trustworthy person who went out of his way to help others. \u201cI was getting married in December 2016, a month after demonetisation. Lalit bhaiyya used to stand in queues outside ATMs at 3 a.m. because I needed cash,\u201d he said as tears rolled down his eyes. Narayan Devi\u2019s daughters-in-law Savita and Tina fitted the stereotype of able homemakers. They woke up early, cooked for the family, took care of the children and elders, and were polite and well-behaved with everyone they met. \u201cSavita bhabhi did not seem very educated. Tina, on the other hand, was well-read and worldly, but both of them adhered to whatever Auntyji [Narayan Devi] said,\u201d said Preet Kaur Mann, another neighbour who knew the Chundawat family for over 20 years. Ms. Mann recalled the \u201cthoughtful\u201d nature of Savita and Tina with an anecdote. \u201cA few months ago, the wife of one of their workers broke her leg. The Chundawats kept the woman at their house and both the bhabhis took care of her.\u201d The elder son, Bhavnesh, was much more communicative than his younger brother, said Ms. Sharma. His grocery store was an \u2018adda\u2019 for people from all walks of life to come and chit-chat, and he would entertain them all with a warm smile. Bhavnesh\u2019s daughter Neetu was a constant support for him as she used to sit with him at his shop and manage the finances. Her uncle Dinesh said she stood by her father like a rock. The neighbours said that they are most shocked by Neetu\u2019s death. \u201cShe was a very confident and bubbly girl,\u201d said Amrik Singh Mann, Ms. Mann\u2019s husband. She was the one who broke the news of the recent shootout in Burari to all the neighbours. \u201cWe do not understand how she got influenced into participating in such an exercise [the death],\u201d said Mr. Mann. Neetu had completed Class XII from DAV Public School and pursued her bachelors and masters degrees in commerce through correspondence. Mr. Mehta said Neetu and her younger sister Maneka used to visit Tohana and stay at his house. Neetu was pursuing her masters from Lovely Professional University and the centre of her examination was near Tohana. Maneka, on the other hand, was a quiet person for whom her studies mattered the most. She had completed her B.Sc from Delhi University and wanted to pursue masters in forensic science. \u201cManeka did not open up to people much. She would go to her class, come back home and keep to her books mostly,\u201d recalled Ms. Sharma. Like Maneka, Shivam and Dhruv too were bright students and always scored well in their exams. They were fond of motorbikes and cars, which the family did not possess. Their friend Jatin recalled that the two followed a set routine and studied for at least two hours before going out to play at night. \u201cWe used to play cricket and go cycling almost every day. But for some reason they did not come to play in the last week of June,\u201d said the 15-year-old. Jatin said both Dhruv and Shivam were extremely \u201cgod-fearing\u201d for their age. \u201cOn Sundays they used to worship the sun by offering water. Boys our age do not usually do that.\u201d The two teenagers had no access to laptops and mobile phones, their friends said, adding that both of them could only use the computer at their house and that too under the surveillance of someone older. \u201cThey were not allowed to use mobile phones. They would sometimes ask me for mine but Lalit bhaiyya had instructed me not to give it to them,\u201d Ali said. Their uncle, Mr. Dinesh, remembered how the boys were fond of riding his two-wheeler. \u201cWe have learnt from mama [uncle], please let us ride it,\u201d they used to tell him. A teacher at their school \u2013 Virendra Public School \u2013 said the boys were in the same class and had the same set of friends. \u201cThey were extremely bright students and were also very active in extracurricular activities. They hardly missed school,\u201d he said. Jatin and his brother Aditya (11) were students of Pratibha. She used to take tuitions at home in the evening for students up to Class VIII. \u201cShe was a tough teacher but a good one. She would scold us if we did not do our homework. She would also complain to our parents,\u201d said Jatin. As for their part-time teacher Priyanka who used to teach them during her off days on weekends, Jatin and Aditya sang in chorus, \u201cPinkudi was the best.\u201d Priyanka, her neighbour Ms. Mann said, was a private person. She was not \u201cloud\u201d like her cousin Neetu, neither as quiet as Maneka. Priyanka was somewhere in the middle, who liked to live her life \u201cin a controlled way\u201d. Ms. Mann, who attended Priyanka\u2019s engagement on June 17, said the woman requested her not to post pictures on Facebook and tag her as she did not want people to know yet. At CPA Global, where Priyanka was working since 2012, her seniors said, \u201cShe was exemplary at her work, and had won many trophies and certificates.\u201d Her manager recalled that while she was cordial with everyone in office, she only had two-three friends who she used to interact with. \u201cIn fact, nobody at work knew that she was engaged. Only one of her friends was aware but even she was not invited,\u201d he said. Priyanka used to participate in regular office events but \u201cnot the ones that stretched till late night\u201d, he added. Not one of the family members gave Mr. Dinesh a hint of what was going on inside the Burari house. Though he is yet to come to terms with the tragedy, he said he could think of only one explanation for the secrecy. \u201cThey knew I did not believe in anything supernatural. They knew if they had told me, I would have stopped them at any cost.\u201d ", "title": "Burari deaths: 11 bright people with one dark secret - The Hindu", "author": "Hemani Bhandari", "date": "July

(MHA), through a notification in the Gazette of India on October 11, enhanced the \u201carrest, search and seize\u201d powers of the Border Security Force (BSF) up to 50 km from the international boundary within Assam, West Bengal and Punjab. In Gujarat, the limit was reduced from the existing 80 km to 50 km. In Rajasthan, the 50-km limit remains unchanged. The notification replaces a 2014 order under the BSF Act, 1968, which also empowers the force to conduct counter-insurgency operation in Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura, Nagaland and Meghalaya. Though Jammu and Kashmir was not mentioned in the 2014 order, references to it exist in a previous such amendments in 1973. The October 11 order specifically mentions the two newly created Union Territories-J&K and Ladakh. The BSF is a central armed police force (CAPF) that functions under the Union government. It was raised in 1965 in the aftermath of the India-Pakistan war. The BSF Act was passed by Parliament in 1968 and the rules governing the Act were framed in 1969. The MHA issues all orders pertaining to the BSF and other CAPFs such as the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB), Indo Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), National Security Guard (NSG) and Assam Rifles. India is a Union of States and under One Border One Force policy, the BSF is deployed along the Pakistan and Bangladesh borders. It is also deployed in areas affected by Left Wing Extremism (LWE) and is routinely deployed for election and other law and order duties on the request of State governments. According to a background note submitted by the MHA to a parliamentary standing committee in 2011, Under Rule 15 of the BSF Rules, 1969, the BSF has been assigned three primary tasks while deployed along the borders: promote a sense of security among the people living in the border area, prevent trans-border crimes/unauthorised entry into or exit from the territory of India and prevent smuggling and any other illegal activity. The violations against which the BSF carries out search and seizure include smuggling of narcotics, prohibited items, illegal entry of foreigners and offences punishable under any other Central Act. The MHA has given powers to the BSF personnel in border areas under the Customs Act, the Passport Act, the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Subsances Act, the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), Registration of Foreigners Act, 1939, the Central Excises and Salt Act, 1944, the Foreigners Act, 1946, and the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1947. The BSF does not have police powers; after apprehending a suspect it can only conduct \u201cpreliminary questioning\u201d and has to hand over a seized consignment or the suspect to the local police within 24 hours. It does not have powers to prosecute crime suspects. Police is a State subject under the Constitution. According to a BSF official, the amendment \u201cestablishes uniformity in defining the area within which the BSF can operate\u201d and also to improve its operational effectiveness in curbing trans-border crimes. The operational writ of the BSF was different in different border States and the fresh notification ends this anomaly. The two Opposition ruled border States- Punjab and West Bengal, have termed the MHA\u2019s move an attack on federalism. Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi has demanded a rollback. However, State\u2019s Deputy Chief Minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa said the Chief Minister never made such a demand with the Central Government. The ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC)in West Bengal has termed the move an \u201cinfringement\u201d on the rights of the State and an attack on the federal structure of the country.

The 37-year-old Chhetri went past the legendary Pele and equalled Lionel Messi when he scored the team\u2019s opener \u2014 and his 80th goal \u2014 against Nepal in the summit clash on Saturday. \u201cLook at the youngsters \u2014 it feels good for all of them. It\u2019s all due to their hard work. We were here for 20 days till the final, staying on an island, riding the waves every day for practice sessions, and matches,\u201d Chhetri said in a release from All India Football Federation. \u201cWe made it special as we were not so good in the first two games. It was tough from there to come up and play the way we did,\u201d added Chhetri after his third triumph in the SAFF Championship as a player. Chhetri has won the regional tournament in 2011 and 2015 also. \u201cDidn\u2019t start like we should have, but ended exactly how we wanted to. Proud of this bunch and the way we got things on track,\u201d he later said in a tweet. Chhetri was all praise for the other two Indian goal getters on Saturday -- Suresh Singh and Sahal Abdul Samad. \u201cI enjoyed watching that, Sahal. Suresh, of all the things you copy from me, this is up there. Make it a habit,\u201d said the captain. Sahal, on his part, said it was an \u201cunbelievable\u201d moment and \u201ca miracle\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened inside the box. I came in for the last 4-5 minutes.

This is why I was not surprised to be invited to the opening of the newly-remodelled Satya Paul store at Delhi\u2019s DLF Promenade mall in September. Far-sighted businesspeople know that property becomes more accessible when a calamity, let\u2019s say a global pandemic, hits and smaller players are forced out. They also know that however long it lasts, there will be a time when human nature will become inured to its horrific reality, and shop. We will always shop to mark our personal and family milestones, and to feel alive. With this realisation, I look at the story of brand Satya Paul\u2019s revival with great interest. And if we allow ourselves to, the Indian fashion industry can learn a lot from this iconic label\u2019s new direction. \u201cThe first thing we did,\u201d says Darshan Mehta, President and CEO of Reliance Brands (RBL), \u201cwas to shrink the label almost to half its market size\u201d. This process began in April 2019 after Reliance Brands upped its investment in Genesis Colors, Satya Paul\u2019s holding company. By June, designer Rajesh Pratap Singh had come on board as Creative Director. \n\n\n\n\n\nDarshan Mehta, President and CEO of Reliance Brands\n\u00a0\n| Photo Credit: Special Arrangement \n\n\n\n\n Before the hiring of one of India\u2019s most talented designers, though, were the Dark Ages; a decade or so when Satya Paul\u2019s brand name, made iconic by the founder\u2019s groundbreaking saris since the mid-1980s, stood diluted with badly-regulated franchisees across the land and indiscriminately offered product categories. These ranged from logo-ed wallets and tie pins to cut pieces of cheap digital prints on Chinese satins, crepes, and georgettes. Corporate gifting catalogues touted ready boxes of tie-pocket square-cuff links combos sourced from our infamously productive neighbour nation, while the in-house design team tried feebly to break into the wedding market with digital-printed \u2018couture\u2019 lehengas and gowns. It was a Pierre Cardin situation. And bringing hot young talent Masaba on board in 2012 didn\u2019t help either, because she never truly had the run of the brand. Most Indian designers who have been around for a few years will resonate with these struggles. But today, with the industry as a whole having suffered first the exodus of its artisans during the CAA-NRC debacle and then facing the realities of a global pandemic for a year and a half, Satya Paul\u2019s long struggles can become teachable moments. \u201cGiven the history of the brand, we had to do something drastic,\u201d adds Mehta. \u201cAs part of the new strategy, we began cleaning up the market.\u201d Consequently, the label closed all of its franchisees, and even bought back stock from the distributors who would sell to MBOs, no matter which collection or season it belonged to. \n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the collection\n\u00a0\n| Photo Credit: Special Arrangement \n\n\n\n\n \u201cWe needed to go back to the beating heart of the brand,\u201d says Mehta. And this is where Rajesh Pratap Singh came in. In terms of design, Singh went back to the brand archives, pulling out old examples of the founder\u2019s work with the weavers of Benaras and Telangana, as well as his floral prints and his experiments with colour and printmaking. \u201cHow would Mr Paul design ready-to-wear if he were here now? What can we do with the medium of digital printing without making it excessive and, therefore, meaningless?\u201d are some of the questions that he asked, and answered through his first two collections for the label. \u201cWe went back to the Ikat weavers Mr Paul had worked with and made double-palla saris in double Ikat, as well as a whole line of Jamdanis in floral Art Nouveau motifs that we dug up from the archives,\u201d he adds. \u201cLikewise, we did Khaduas and a few Phekwas from Benaras inspired by Mr Paul\u2019s floral motifs. Printmaking came with a load of history and baggage, so the first thing was to clean up the palate. These are not seasonal products; this is an ongoing process,\u201d says Singh. Today, with its numerous franchisees closed and its owned stores going through makeovers, Satya Paul\u2019s retail presence across India is beginning to look more like the tightly-managed brick-and-mortar strategies employed by luxury brands that concentrate on experiential touch points rather than chasing numbers. \u201cI have become tired and a little defensive about a question that has been coming at me for the last 20 years: why isn\u2019t there a luxury brand coming out of India? Now I feel it\u2019s time we give a fitting answer, even if it takes two or five or 10 years,\u201d says Mehta. \n\n\n\n\n\nRajesh Pratap Singh\n\u00a0\n| Photo Credit: Special Arrangement \n\n\n\n\n To do this, he has a two-pronged approach. Giving Singh complete freedom to take the brand forward in a direction in keeping with the earliest values of the label \u2014 bold prints, colour, and luxury \u2014 while restraining the retail spaces. \u201cThe store at Promenade in Delhi is already open, and we\u2019re opening a flagship at the new Jio World Drive Mall soon. Another store will open at Delhi\u2019s Khan Market in late November\u2026\u201d he lists. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at around 10 to 12 locations at the most.\u201d For Singh, it\u2019s a strategy that works, whether it\u2019s for Satya Paul or in general. \u201cWe\u2019ve been told for so long that physical retail is on its way out and everything is going online, but the truth is that when it comes to luxury fashion, people do want to come and interact with what they intend to buy,\u201d he says. The key, apart from great service and storytelling by the sales staff, is to bring people into the brand universe. \n\n\n\n\n\nSatya Paul\u2019s new store\n\u00a0\n| Photo Credit: Special Arrangement \n\n\n\n\n It is a straightforward strategy that will need time to prove itself, as does anything that the stakeholders are willing to commit to. Perhaps, amid the new wave of Indian brands being acquired by corporate bigwigs like Reliance Brands and the Aditya Birla Group, it can show India\u2019s fashion designers the way forward when it comes to making their mark in retail.

He suffers but keeps the fire burning and \u2014 almost 21 years after the massacre \u2014 shoots down Michael O\u2019 Dwyer, the governor of Punjab, who had ordered General Dyer to punish the peaceful protesters in London during a public event. He is sentenced to death, but his trial raises important questions about the distinction between a revolutionary and a terrorist, murder as a tool of protest, the use of Section 144, and went on to expose the Empire to the world. Thousands of Indian soldiers sacrificed their lives for the Empire during the First World War, but O\u2019 Dwyer still wanted to teach peaceful protesters at the Jallianwala Bagh a lesson. Also Read | Why Shoojit Sircar had to wait for two decades to make \u2018Sardar Udham\u2019 Director Shoojit Sircar explores contentious definitions and concerns, as India continues to grapple with the idea of dissent, and Section 144 remains a questionable, repressive tool in the hands of the government of the day. A potent blend of reason and emotion, Shoojit doesn\u2019t look at the past from a lens tinted with unqualified devotion. Without making a show of it, he digs into the meaning of Udham\u2019s actions. Just like how the alias Ram Mohammad Singh Azad that Udham gave for the trial, became a statement in itself against the divide and rule policy of the British, comes through a dialogue between a British investigative officer and his superior. Sardar UdhamDirector: Shoojit SircarCast: Vicky Koushal, Amol Parashar, Shaun Scott, Banita Sandhu, Stephen HoganDuration: 162 minutesStoryline: The undeterred mission of Sardar Udham Singh to avenge the lives of his beloved brethren, who were ruthlessly murdered in the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre of 1919 In the patriotic space, dialogues tend to get didactic, but Ritesh Shah refrains from long-winded monologues and keeps the tone youthful and realistic, as he, along with Shubhendu Bhattacharya, sprinkles the screenplay with both the idealistic and romantic sides of Udham. The man who swore by absolute freedom took the customary court oath on Heer Ranjha. The British characters also don\u2019t come across as black cardboards. They are persuasive in defending the \u201cwhite man\u2019s burden\u201d which Udham describes as an evil design of the Empire to loot India. They may have been fictionalised, but some of the best moments come through during the conversations between O\u2019 Dwyer and Udham when the latter worked as his aide. They provide an insight into what the British rulers thought of Indians in general. The production design and cinematography team have recreated the period with diligence, succeeding in transporting us to the times when the world was gradually slipping towards another World War. \n\n\n\n\n\nVicky Kaushal in a still from the film\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n Above all, the non-linear editing makes the content all the more compelling, hiding the gaps in the material available on Udham. The idea of putting the action part before the motivation keeps the audience engaged. Known for his penchant for detail, Shoojit has picturised the heartbreaking Jallianwala Bagh episode with a microscope. It provides a foundation for Udham\u2019s anguish. The sequence where Udham holds a wounded Sikh on his shoulder, with his kesh (long hair) flowing against the dim light, leaves you with a big lump in the throat long after the credits roll. The almost 30-minute long depiction of the massacre and its aftermath is perhaps the most moving depiction of human misery, after Govind Nihalani\u2019s Tamas. On the flip side, while the British response to Udham has been depicted in great detail, the Indian political leadership\u2019s response to his act has been completely ignored. The Congress\u2019 reaction to Udham Singh\u2019s case has been kept out. The influential V.K. Krishna Menon who represented him in the court, along with John Hutchinson, has been kept out of the frame. Vicky Kaushal embodies the pride and pain of a revolutionary without going overboard. He oozes the confidence of a freedom fighter who can\u2019t be broken by relentless torture and turns out to be the right choice for a role that was originally imagined for Irrfan. The broken English does irritate at times, but his malleable body language and evocative eye movement make up for it. As Bhagat Singh, Amol Parashar looks the part in close-ups, but unlike Vicky, his effort shows in making the revolutionary look cool and happening. The strong English support cast led by Shaun Scott and Stephen Hogan makes it a wholesome experience.

The Nihang activists who are responsible for the murder must be apprehended immediately and tried for the horrific crime. Their blatant disregard for the rule of law is evident in the manner in which they have justified their crime and in their nonchalance in accepting responsibility for it citing their religious sect\u2019s traditional practices. The Haryana government must spare no effort in bringing the culprits to justice, should appeal for the strictest punishment and a message must be sent that the claims of religious sanction for violence are illegal and are punishable. While the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), which includes various farmer groups and has led the protests, has rightly distanced itself from the Nihangs and their actions and asked that the perpetrators be brought to book, it remains a question as to why groups which base themselves on religious traditions have been allowed to be a part of protests that are based on economic demands in the first place. In its loose nature of agglomeration, the SKM has sought to articulate the concerns by subsuming the interests of several sections of those involved in the farm sector. But it is clear that the nature of the protests \u2014 as demonstrations and protests by non-political party groups \u2014 has allowed it to be utilised by sectarian outfits for their ends. The SKM has been a non-political party movement in order to articulate demands related solely to the farm laws and to direct the protests at the Union government. But in doing so, it has unwittingly allowed sectarian groups, whose motives are suspect, to share space with them. By and large, the farm agitations have been peaceful, even if their leaders have refused to give up on their position of repealing the laws passed in Parliament, but the incidence of violence such as those seen on Republic Day featuring a set of the agitators, besides the murder at Singhu suggest that the loose nature of the campaign is allowing such incidents to recur. Detractors of the farmers\u2019 movement have sought to denigrate it by reducing it to Sikh separatist and sectarian movements. A political attempt is being made to drive a wedge between the different communities that are a part of the protests, as seen in the reactions in the Lakhimpur Kheri incident in Uttar Pradesh as well. The farm protests cannot be wished away with such a reductive approach. Even as strict actions are taken against violent activists, the atmosphere of distrust that persists between the Government and the farm unions can only be reversed with further talks to address the latter\u2019s concerns with the laws.

Bhutan and China signed the agreement at a videoconference on Thursday. China\u2019s Assistant Foreign Minister Wu Jianghao said the MoU \u201cwill make a meaningful contribution to speeding up the negotiation on demarcation and promoting the process of establishing diplomatic ties between the two countries.\u201d the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

The Chinese state media did, however, hail the MoU as the first \u201cbreakthrough\u201d in the border talks, which began in 1984, with 20 rounds held. Also read: Age of expansionism is over, Narendra Modi says in Ladakh Wang Shida, a South Asia scholar at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, a think-tank affiliated to the Ministry of State Security, told the party-run Global Times the MoU \u201cis a milestone and would help break the deadlock.\u201d \u201cThe boundary issue between China and Bhutan is special because it not only relates to Bhutan but also has become a negative factor for China-India ties,\u201d he said. \u201cIf China and Bhutan make progress in solving boundary disputes, India will have fewer chances and excuses to make trouble on border areas.\u201d Wang Se, another expert at CICIR, expressed the commonly held view in Beijing that India\u2019s concerns over the Doklam plateau, the site of the 2017 stand-off with China, was one reason for negotiations stalling in the past couple of years, with New Delhi wary over a border deal that \u201cwould undermine its interests\u201d. \u201cAfter the Doklam stand-off, China and Bhutan did not hold a meeting for border talks for a long time, which shows India was exerting great influence on Bhutan,\u201d he said. As the talks go forward, it remains unclear to what extent China would be willing to make territorial concessions, which a settlement would require from both sides. Only last year, China appeared to widen its territorial claims, for the first time bringing in Sakteng in eastern Bhutan into the dispute. Earlier negotiations had dealt with territories in Bhutan\u2019s north and west, including Pasamlung and Jakarlung valleys in the north and Doklam to the west. China had, according to reports, previously offered a package solution that would see Beijing controlling Doklam and ceding the northern valleys. The inclusion of Sakteng into the dispute last year was seen by some observers as a negotiating tactic to bring Bhutan back to the table. Since the 2017 stand-off with India, Beijing has already strengthened its de facto control over much of the Doklam plateau, located strategically along the India-China-Bhutan trijunction. Barring the face-off site where India had objected to a road being built that would push the trijunction point further south, China has deepened its presence elsewhere on much of the plateau and faced little opposition from Bhutan in doing so. Chinese media last year even showed images of a newly built village in Doklam, in territory disputed by Bhutan and China, part of a broader effort in building \u201cfront line\u201d border villages and moving in residents to secure territorial claims. While no details of the three-step roadmap have been revealed, Mr. Wang added that the roadmap might follow the three-step process of the India-China border talks. It remains to be seen, however, if the border negotiations with Bhutan would be as tortuous. India and China completed the first step as early as 2005, agreeing political parameters and guiding principles. The second stage of negotiating a framework to solve disputes is still ongoing, and the final step will involve demarcation. Qian Feng of Tsinghua University told the South China Morning Post that the steps \u201cmight include setting up a framework first, confirming the specific disputes with an exchange of maps, and then a resolution stage.\u201d ", "title": "China\u2019s media hail Bhutan deal as \u2018breakthrough\u2019 in border talks - The Hindu", "author": "Ananth Krishnan", "date": "October 16, 2021 08:48 IST", "preprocessed": "thursday agreement china bhutan three step roadmap speed border talk break deadlock negoti report chines medium said bhutan china sign agreement videoconfer thursday china assist foreign minist jianghao said make meaning contribut speed negoti demarc promot process establish diplomat countri chines foreign ministri said statement statement also quot bhutan foreign minist bhutan work china implement unswervingli push forward negoti demarc commit strengthen bilater relat also read talk stalem made construct suggest india unreason demand china bhutan foreign ministri issu brief press releas agreement neither side releas detail roadmap chines state medium howev hail first breakthrough border talk began 1984 round held also read expansion narendra modi ladakh wang shida south asia scholar china institut contemporari intern relat think tank affili ministri state secur told parti global time mileston would help break deadlock boundari issu china bhutan special relat bhutan also becom factor china india said china bhutan make progress solv boundari disput india fewer chanc excus make troubl border area wang anoth expert cicir express commonli held view beij india concern doklam plateau site 2017 stand china reason negoti stall past coupl year delhi wari border deal would undermin interest doklam stand china bhutan hold meet border talk long time show india exert great influenc bhutan said talk forward remain unclear extent china would make territori concess settlement would requir side onli last year china appear widen territori claim first time bring sakteng eastern bhutan disput earlier negoti dealt territori bhutan north west includ pasamlung jakarlung valley north doklam west china accord report previous offer packag solut would beij control doklam cede northern valley inclus sakteng disput last year seen observ negoti tactic bring bhutan back tabl sinc 2017 stand india beij alreadi strengthen facto control much doklam plateau locat strateg along india china bhutan trijunct face site india object road built would push trijunct point south china deepen presenc elsewher much plateau face littl opposit bhutan chines medium last year even show imag newli built villag doklam territori disput bhutan china part broader effort build front line border villag move resid secur territori claim detail three step roadmap reveal wang roadmap might follow three step process india china border talk remain seen howev border negoti bhutan would tortuou india china complet first step earli 2005 agre polit paramet guid principl second stage negoti framework solv disput still ongo final step involv demarc qian feng tsinghua univers told south china morn post step might includ framework first confirm specif disput exchang resolut stage"}, {"body": "The Army Aviation has recently got control of the Heron-I Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) in the Eastern sector, which were earlier with the Artillery, bringing all aviation assets under one roof and augmenting its ability to keep an eye on Chinese activities across the border. The move comes just months after the raising of a new Aviation Brigade at Missamari, strengthening the Army\u2019s response as well as firepower. \u201cArmy Aviation got control of the UAVs in August this year from Artillery. There are certain advantages of UAVs or Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) being with Army Aviation,\u201d an officer said. The Army Aviation Brigade at Missamari was raised in March this year to enable better command and control of aviation resources, the officer said, adding that in the future battlefield, manned and unmanned aircraft teaming will reap huge dividends. The Brigade operates the Cheetah and Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Dhruv utility helicopters, Rudra weaponsied ALH and Heron-I UAVs. Three RPA flights are working under the Army Aviation squadrons which consists of around 14 UAVs, according to the officer. With the UAVs being under the Army Aviation, the receipt capability has become seamless and more responsive, officials said. All aerial assets are under one umbrella which allows optimised employment of RPAs during operations in conjunction with other aviation assets. \u201cIt also helps in upgradation of flight safety management and practices and also boosts training infrastructure for RPA aircrew,\u201d the first officer cited above said. \u201cIt also ensures better maintenance and serviceability by optimising the supply chain and spares management,\u201d the officer said and added, \u201cIt smoothens out the Command and Control process especially during operations.\u201d Talking to a group of visiting journalists on the new inductions, Lt. Col. Amit Dadwal posted at the base said it has given them round the clock capability for surveillance as well as operations. He said the ALH has become the backbone of the main operations of the Army as of now. \u201cWith the ALH we have been doing night casualty evacuation,\u201d he added. The Army has 90 ALH and 75 Rudra helicopters in service which are indigenously designed and developed by the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL). The Army Aviation is also very soon slated to induct a surveillance downlink system, anti-aircraft missiles, countermeasures against missile systems, new generation surveillance pods among others which will enhance the existing role to manifold, as reported by The Hindu earlier. In the last few years, the Army and Air Force have significantly upgraded their defences in the Eastern sector including induction of new equipment as part of efforts to match China\u2019s build up and infrastructure development on its aide of the Line of Actual (LAC). There has also been a major impetus to infrastructure development in the region. The Israeli Heron-I UAVs are in the process of being upgraded and officials said they will also be deployed in this sector in due course.  In addition, the Army has recently leased four Heron-TP Medium Altitude Long Endurance (MALE) Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) from Israel Aircraft Industries which are much more capable than the Heron-1s. These are expected to be deployed in Eastern Ladakh in the backdrop of the standoff which began last year and is still continuing. During the standoff in Eastern Ladakh, the Army Aviation had seen a quantum jump in the employment of helicopters along the Northern borders. However, a major issue of concern is the ageing fleet of Cheetah and Chetak helicopters and their delayed replacement. About 75% of the Army\u2019s fleet of Cheetah and Chetak helicopters, which are its mainstay, is over 30 years old and some of them are about 50 years old. The technical life of these helicopters will wind down from 2023, which will further exacerbate the deficiencies. The Ka-226T utility helicopter deal with Russia along with the indigenous Light Utility Helicopter (LUH) are meant to replace them but the Ka-226T deal has been stalled for several years over the percentage of indigenisation.

He lives every artist\u2019s dream \u2014 as soon as the portraits drawn by him are revealed, they are seen and shared by millions of people and media channels around the world. Yet, he\u2019s not a household name. That might change, thanks to a tweet from the Nobel committee stating that Elmehed is the artist behind the distinctive gold-and-black portraits that accompany the annual proclamation of the Nobel Prize winners. How much time is he given, before the announcement, to draw the portraits? This question, now most frequently asked, is one that he\u2019s not allowed to answer. \u201cUnfortunately, I can\u2019t tell you that, it\u2019s confidential!\u201d he says with easy good humour, on a Zoom call with The Hindu Weekend from the Nobel committee headquarters in Stockholm. With the Nobel Prizes, it\u2019s not just timing that\u2019s everything, it\u2019s the confidentiality as well. But he can tell us how drawing the laureates is both a marathon and a sprint. \u201cI\u2019m pretty fast, so it\u2019s a few hours for each portrait. There\u2019s a lot of preparation before \u2014 it\u2019s like a sports event: you have to train for weeks, even years, then go to the race, and finish in a very short time,\u201d says Elmehed, 44, who has been doing these portraits since 2012. \n\n\n\n\n\nNiklas Elmehed\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n Initially an art director with the Nobel group, he later realised that \u201cto present the winners using photos was very tricky\u201d. As they could not be informed ahead of the announcement, fresh photography was not possible. Existing photos had copyright issues, as well as the problem of poor quality images for the less famous winners. \u201cI got the job of developing a graphic style that would become a brand, and give great impact to the revelation of the winners. I work a lot with their eyes \u2014 it\u2019s as though they are looking directly at the viewer. The concept behind it is to have that \u2018breaking news\u2019 feeling. When people see these images, they immediately associate them with the Nobel Prize announcements,\u201d he says. On the wall behind Elmehed are rows of portraits of previous laureates. The form has changed from an initial blue-and-yellow to the current black-and-gold on white paper. This was in keeping with the rebranding of the Nobel Prize that uses the colour gold during the announcements. To explain the artistic process, Elmehed fetches the latest portraits and holds them close to the camera. \u201cI use an opaque black vinyl colour applied with fine brushes to do the super-thin lines, like in normal painting. But the gold is a little bit special. I use a metal foil, which you can see shimmer, mounted on to a special glue that\u2019s totally transparent. Sometimes, when I\u2019m in a hurry, I use a heating gun to speed up the drying process.\u201d It is a clever and extremely egalitarian use of the drawing medium: there is a sense of equality, as no single winner has a better photograph than the others. \n\n\n\n\n\nNiklas Elmehad at work\n\u00a0\n| Photo Credit: Special Arrangement \n\n\n\n\n In terms of inspiration, Elmehed did a lot of black-and-white charcoal drawings while studying at The Royal Institute of Art and KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. The gold foil has a connection with ancient icon paintings. \u201cIn the portraits, you get these old traditions linked to the graphical style of the digital era.\u201d As a freelance artist, his clients include the Swedish national football team, and corporates such as Tencent. He has also done commissioned portraits, often for the purpose of gifting, in his trademark vinyl-and-gold leaf style. While these bring great joy to the recipients, he clarifies it\u2019s possible only if \u201cthe portrait is of someone not famous, and certainly not in any kind of running for a Nobel Prize!\u201d Outside of art and portrait-making, life is busy as a father of three. \u201cMy family is into different kinds of sports. I help the children with their gymnastics, football, basketball\u2026 and I love to play football and do kickboxing.\u201d While the current social media buzz hasn\u2019t much affected his personal life, the family does find it fascinating when famous people retweet his artwork. He confesses, \u201cIt was a little special when Barack Obama re-tweeted this year\u2019s Peace Prize announcement that had my portraits of the journalists in it!\u201d Contact Elmehed on niklaselmehed.com | Instagram and Twitter: @niklaselmehed | Facebook: facebook.com/elmehed ", "title": "Behind Niklas Elmehed\u2019s gold portraits of Nobel Prize winners - The Hindu", "author": "Parvathi Nayar", "date": "October 15, 2021 18:37 IST", "preprocessed": "swedish artist nikla elmeh anonym celebr life everi artist dream soon portrait drawn reveal seen share million peopl medium channel around world household name might chang thank tweet nobel committe state elmeh artist behind distinct gold black portrait accompani annual proclam nobel prize winner much time given announc draw portrait question frequent allow answer unfortun tell confidenti easi good humour zoom call hindu weekend nobel committe headquart stockholm nobel prize time everyth confidenti well tell draw laureat marathon sprint pretti fast hour portrait prepar like sport event train week even year race finish short time elmeh portrait sinc 2012 nikla elmeh initi director nobel group later realis present winner photo tricki could inform ahead announc fresh photographi possibl exist photo copyright issu well problem poor qualiti imag famou winner develop graphic style would becom brand give great impact revel winner work though look directli viewer concept behind break news feel peopl imag immedi associ nobel prize announc wall behind elmeh portrait previou laureat form chang initi blue yellow current black gold white paper keep rebrand nobel prize colour gold announc explain artist process elmeh fetch latest portrait hold close camera opaqu black vinyl colour appli fine brush super thin line like normal paint gold littl special metal foil shimmer mount special glue total transpar sometim hurri heat speed process clever extrem egalitarian draw medium sens equal singl winner better photograph nikla elmehad work photo credit special arrang term inspir elmeh black white charcoal draw studi royal institut royal institut technolog stockholm gold foil connect ancient icon paint portrait tradit link graphic style digit freelanc artist client includ swedish nation footbal team corpor tencent also done commiss portrait often purpos gift trademark vinyl gold leaf style bring great recipi clarifi possibl portrait someon famou certainli kind nobel prize outsid portrait make life busi father three famili differ kind sport help child gymnast footbal basketbal love play footbal kickbox current social medium buzz much affect person life famili find fascin famou peopl retweet artwork confess littl special barack obama tweet year peac prize announc portrait journalist contact elmeh niklaselmeh instagram twitter niklaselmeh facebook facebook elmeh"}, {"body": "Taapsee Pannu has come a long way from her early years \u2014 projects in Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam, and Hindi \u2014 where she was mostly a decorative afterthought.

(GHI) this year rubbished the Government's allegation on Saturday that its ranking of India as among the 16 worst countries was based on an opinion poll. It also pointed out that the Government was wrong to confuse \u2018undernourishment\u2019 with \u201cundernutrition\u201d. Following the launch of the GHI on Thursday which ranked India 101 of 116 countries, the Government expressed its shock and questioned the \u2018unscientific\u2019 methodology used by its two publishers, Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe, that relies on a \u201cfour-question\u201d opinion poll to calculate one of the four indicators used to arrive at the GHI score. The Government singled out the \u2018undernourishment\u2019 indicator, because it was the only one where India\u2019s performance deteriorated relative to previous years \u2014 undernourishment prevalence rose from 14% to 15.3% between 2017-2019 and 2018-2020. \u201cThe FAO\u2019s telephone-based opinion indicator \u2014 the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES) \u2014\u2014 is not used in the GHI. The GHI uses the prevalence of undernourishment indicator, which is assessed by FAO using Food Balance Sheet data from each country,\u201d Miriam Wiemers, Advisor Global Hunger Index, told The Hindu in an email. A Food Balance Sheet presents a comprehensive picture of the pattern of a country\u2019s food supply during a specified reference period. It shows for each food item the sources of supply and its utilisation. The GHI rankings of one year can\u2019t be compared to those of previous years due to data revisions and changes in methodology. The Ministry of Women and Child Development on Friday said instead of relying on a poll, the Index should have used measurement of weight and height to calculate the \u2018undernourishment\u2019 indicator. \u201cThis represents a misunderstanding of the undernourishment indicator. Undernourishment is a measure of the proportion of the population with inadequate access to calories and is based on data regarding the food supply in the country. It is not a measure of weight and height,\u201d adds Ms. Weimers. The other three indicators that form the GHI score include wasting (low weight for height), stunting (low height for age) and under-five mortality rate so the Government\u2019s argument that the index should have used weight and height falls flat on its face. \u201cStunting and wasting measure undernutrition of the child population, but that is different from the undernourishment indicator,\u201d explains Ms Weimers. The Government was also wrong to say the performance of four neighbouring countries \u2014 Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka \u2014 on the undernourishment indicator was shown to have improved. Three of the four countries in fact showed an increase in prevalence of undernourishment between 2017-2019 and 2018-2020 \u2014 in Afghanistan it rose from 23.4% to 25.6%, in Nepal from 4.3% to 4.8% and in Sri Lanka from 6% to 6.8%. This is not the first time the Government has rejected the Global Hunger Index. In March, Minister for Women and Child Development (WCD) Smriti Irani told Parliament that the GHI was flawed. \u201cTwo indicators namely stunting and wasting are outcomes of complex interactions of various other factors like sanitation, genetics, environment, and utilisation of food intake apart from hunger... there is hardly any evidence that the fourth indicator namely child mortality is an outcome of hunger,\u201d Ms. Irani said. The WHH has been in touch with the Indian Government since it raised its concerns earlier this year. \u201cWe have been in contact with the Indian Government in the past explaining the methodology and indicator data. In July, we informed the WCD about the source data for the four indicators that would be used for this year's report,\u201d the GHI Advisor said. \u201cThe Global Hunger Index is a report that is peer reviewed by external experts. The methodology has long been established and tested. The international community \u2014 including India \u2014 has agreed upon the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and the GHI uses indicators that are part of the internationally recognised indicator set to measure progress toward the SDGs,\u201d Ms. Weimers told The Hindu. \u201cThe prevalence of undernourishment is recognised as one indicator for Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2.1 on ensuring access to safe, nutritious and sufficient food for all. Reducing child stunting and wasting by 2025 are also recognised as indicators to track progress on SDG 2.2 on ending all forms of malnutrition. Reducing preventable deaths of children under five years of age is listed as SDG 3.2,\u201d Ms .Wiemers said explaining the rationale for using the four indicators.

A large part of this exercise consists of constituency mapping, or gathering data about caste and community demographics, information about the local balance of power between groups, and the identification of local caste leaders, with the aim of matching candidates\u2019 selection with a particular reading of the socio-political characteristics of each seat. These caste-based strategies also include larger-scale equations, in which parties target their discourse towards specific segments of the electorate, again defined along caste lines. In recent months, we have seen the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Samajwadi Party (SP) amplifying gestures towards Brahmin communities, hoping to bank on the resentment generated by an overtly pro-Rajput administration.  \n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nIn U.P., \u2018upper castes\u2019 led by Brahmins, Thakurs still occupy largest chunk of Ministries \n\n\n\n\u00a0 \nIn U.P., \u2018upper castes\u2019 led by Brahmins, Thakurs still occupy largest chunk of Ministries  Both practices \u2014 micro- and macro-caste targeting \u2014 have been used in Indian politics, and in Uttar Pradesh in particular, for a long time. The incentives for parties and candidates to look at the electorate through the lens of caste are clear: caste makes a complex social and political scene readable. It simplifies things. It spares parties from having to address what individuals want, by clubbing individual aspirations into collective ones, based on their ascriptive identities. But reading politics or the electorate exclusively through the lens of caste leads to many over-simplifications and misconceptions about the ways caste operates as a political variable. For instance, much is made about caste voting and caste and party alignments. Pre-poll and post-poll surveys seek to investigate the electoral behaviour of large groups taken as a whole. In reality, most voters in Uttar Pradesh do not belong to groups that are associated in any stable way with any party. Caste politics is the game of a few and not of many. Most castes are too small or too geographically scattered, or too poor, to constitute a core support base for any party or candidate, even locally. As a result, only a few groups vote cohesively for specific parties, such as the Jatavs for the BSP, the Yadavs for the SP, upper castes with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and so on. And even then, the extent of cohesiveness in these groups\u2019 support to the parties that seek to represent them greatly varies through time. According to a Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS)/Lokniti survey data, since 2007, the support of Jatavs and Yadavs for the BSP and SP has eroded. The same survey data reveal a growing rift among Yadavs along class lines, richer Yadavs being more likely to vote for the BJP. Over the past 30 years, upper-caste voters have not always supported the BJP cohesively and neither have the large number of small, non-dominant Other Backward Classes and Dalit groups that today constitute the other core of its electoral base in Uttar Pradesh.  \n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nCabinet reshuffle | Inductions from U.P. reflect BJP\u2019s focus on caste equations ahead of 2022 polls\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \nCabinet reshuffle | Inductions from U.P. reflect BJP\u2019s focus on caste equations ahead of 2022 polls\n The data available on how people vote suggest an absence of caste-based block voting and show instead caste-party alignments that are loose, and fluctuate over time. Since 2014, the BJP has successfully developed a strategy based on the micro-targeting of small groups. To achieve this, it has used a combination of approaches or registers of mobilisation that include caste appeal, through the organisation of small caste melas, the induction of non-dominant OBC leaders within the party, the sponsoring of small caste/community events, and so forth. It also uses the rhetoric of inclusion and justice by claiming to be non-discriminatory in the distribution and provision of public goods and welfare benefits. In the process, they depict their adversaries as elitist political parties that treat their core support base preferentially. Lastly, they also use religion and nationalism as mobilisation tools that are meant to bind together segments of the electorate that have otherwise little interest in common, including the upper castes. This is how the BJP has succeeded in building a social coalition of groups that include both traditional upper-caste elites and non-dominant backward groups.  \n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Hindu vote, an emerging ethnocracy\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \nThe Hindu vote, an emerging ethnocracy\n Caste in this context does not lose its salience but is merely part of a strategy that uses a variety of discourses to mobilise voters. Caste arithmetic matters, but is insufficient in and of itself to win an election. For instance, caste considerations will still largely determine the distribution of tickets, which, in turn, will shape the representation of various groups in the State Assembly. But it does not account for the complexity of voters\u2019 electoral behaviour, nor for overall party appeal or campaign effects. Another indicator of the fluctuating association between caste and politics is the relatively small number of caste strongholds, defined as seats that regularly return MLAs who may belong to different parties but belong to the same caste. In 2017, 319 seats changed hands in terms of party, owing to the strong performance of the BJP, which won 272 of these seats (it retained 40 of the 47 seats it won in 2012). Of these 319 seats, only 74 elected an MLA from the same caste as in 2012. Overall, the caste retention of seats in an Assembly of 403 was 34% (139 MLAs), which includes re-elected MLAs and new MLAs from the same or from different parties.  \n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nThe construct behind the \u2018Shining U.P.\u2019 card\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \nThe construct behind the \u2018Shining U.P.\u2019 card\n Even before the 2007 delimitation, the number of caste strongholds was quite limited. Between 1996 and 2007, voters elected MLAs who belong to the same caste consecutively in only 94 seats (28 of which were won by the same party in the three elections). This fact alone, combined with an overall high electoral volatility, indicates that caste demographics do not have the deterministic effect on electoral outcomes that is often assumed. Caste-based strategies are also more likely to be effective when the electorate and the party system are highly fragmented. Parties can seek to build minimal caste coalitions at the constituency level to get the minimum number of votes required to garner seats. Before 2017, the average vote share of winners, or winning thresholds, hovered at around 35%. This played to the advantage of regional parties, who could combine the strength of their core support base with the votes that candidates belonging to other castes could bring on their own. This was known as the transferability of vote bank. But after 2012, the rise of the BJP reduced the fragmentation of the party system, which meant the winning threshold was pushed higher. In 2017, the average vote share of winners was 43%, against 35% in 2012. In such a context, strategies that rely mostly on caste arithmetic become insufficient, since it is much harder to mobilise many castes at the same time in fragmented constituencies.  \n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nDecoding the political battle for Uttar Pradesh\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \nDecoding the political battle for Uttar Pradesh\n This explains why the BJP holds considerable advantage against its adversaries. Beyond the question of resources and organisational strength, the BJP has developed the ability to reach out to a wide array of groups by using multiple registers of mobilisation, including caste, religion, nationalism, welfare, and an anti-elite discourse targeting its opponents. In contrast, the BSP and the SP seem to rely on the strategies that helped them win majorities in 2007 and 2012, but that have proved ineffective to counter the BJP\u2019s dominance over the past three elections (2014, 2017 and 2019). The future will tell if these parties can reinvent their electoral strategies. The one thing that is certain for them at this point is that time is running short.

the Karnataka Government will come out with an employment policy for providing incentives to industries and entrepreneurs who provide the maximum number of jobs. Karnataka would also formulate an R&D policy to promote research and development across all sectors of the economy. After inaugurating a workshop on \u2018Udyami Aagu, Udyoga Needu\u2019 (Be an entrepreneur, become an employer) and Kaigarika (industrial) Adalat at the Palace Grounds in Bengaluru on October 11, the Chief Minister said, \u201cThe need of the hour is to provide jobs. Whoever gives more jobs, maximum incentives will be given to them under the (proposed) new employment policy.\u201d The programme, organised by Department of Industries and Commerce, aims to encourage professional youth and students totake up entrepreneurship and employment generation. Mr. Bommai told students that money alone was not enough. \u201cIt is through hard work that one can become an entrepreneur. Consciousness of time and hard work are the hallmarks of an entrepreneur,\u201d he said. The Chief Minister said a synergy between academia and industry needs to be achieved for conducive growth of industries and the job market. Many incentives were being provided to entrepreneurs under the Industrial Policy (2020-25), he said. Section 109 of Karnataka Land Reforms Act, 1961, had been amended for acquisition of farm land for industrial purposes. The start-up policy, semiconductor policy and other policies have transformed Karnataka into an industry-friendly State. The government has provided \u20b950 lakh grant-in-aid each for many start-ups in Bengaluru, and in tier II and III cities. Skilled training would be provided to 75,000 candidates belonging to scheduled castes and tribes, and women graduates, he said. The Industries Department has been holding skill training programmes in various sectors and offering career guidance. The Chief Minister lauded achievements of Industries Minister Murugesh R. Nirani and Minister for Municipal Administration and Small Scale Industries N. Nagaraju (MTB). Mr. Nirani said that students passing out of colleges do not have adequate skills required for industry. The academic curriculum of technical courses needs to be changed to create entrepreneurs among the young. The workshop will provide an opportunity to meet and interact with successful business leaders and entrepreneurs. Former Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa spoke about policies introduced for the benefit of entrepreneurs during his tenure. IT/BT and Higher Education Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan, Cooperation Minister S.T. Somashekar, and Mines & Geology Minister Halappa Achar were present at the event. The Kaigarika Adalat would be held on October 12 to address grievances of industrialists.

The high temperatures seen in Venus meant that any water would have been present in the form of steam.

Essentially a technocentric administrative initiative that promises silo-breaking integration of 16 Ministries including railways, roads and ports through information technology, satellite mapping and data tools, the programme seeks to appeal to the national imagination as an umbrella integrator of \u20b9111-lakh crore worth of projects under the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) for 2020-25. The importance given in the plan to rail-road multimodal connectivity and higher share of freight for the railways \u2014 articulated also by NITI Aayog \u2014 has evident multiple benefits. This includes reducing the cost of logistics to GDP that has prevailed at about 14% even at the time the NDA government took office, to an aspirational 8%. There is also the challenge of reducing vehicular emissions from road freight growth in order to meet climate change commitments and containing input costs due to extraordinarily high taxes on diesel. A similar fillip to efficiency in port operations can increase cargo handling capacity and cut vessel turnaround time. Evidently, States have a crucial role in all this, considering that key pieces of the plan such as port linkages and land availability for highways, railways, industrial clusters and corridors depend on political consensus and active partnership. The observations in the Economic Survey for 2020-21 underscore the role of active Centre-State partnerships for infrastructure building. The Survey projects maximum investments towards NIP sectors such as energy, roads, urban infrastructure and railways for FY 2021 and 22, with about \u20b98.5-lakh crore to be invested by either side annually, besides \u20b94.5-lakh crore per year from the private sector. There is a steep gradient to cover here, as the effects of COVID-19 continue to be felt in terms of lost jobs, depressed wages and consumption, while the planners are pinning their hopes on infrastructure projects for a new deal outcome that will boost jobs and demand for goods and commodities, besides attracting major investments. Significant delays to projects can often be traced to incompatible and hostile land acquisition decisions that alienate communities or threaten to violate environmental integrity. Given the Centre\u2019s preference for Geographic Information Systems and remote sensing to identify potential industrial areas, policymakers would do well to reclaim lands already subjected to degradation and pollution, rather than alienate controversial new parcels. Convincing citizens that they stand to benefit from such grand plans through better social welfare, lower service costs and higher efficiencies, and respecting federal boundaries while dealing with the States are other imperatives.

The DLX1 protein is found at elevated levels in prostate cancer patients, the reason why the DLX1 protein has been used as a urine-based biomarker. Now the team of researchers led by Dr. Bushra Ateeq, Professor at the Department of Biological Sciences and Bioengineering, IIT Kanpur has found that the DLX1 protein, which is expressed at higher levels in the prostate cancer cells, has a huge role in the growth and development of the tumour and the spread of the cancer to other organs in the body (metastasis). Using small molecules as inhibitors, the researchers have shown in mice a new therapeutic strategy to treat people with DLX1-positive prostate cancer. First, the researchers found around 60% of the prostate cancer tissues have higher levels of DLX1 protein. And when the team genetically ablated the DLX1 gene that produces the protein, the ability of cancer cells to grow, develop and spread to other parts of the body was compromised. \u201cWe used mice models to further ascertain the role of DLX1 protein in prostate cancer growth and metastasis,\u201d says Sakshi Goel from IIT Kanpur and first author of a paper published in Nature Communications. To carry out the experiments in mice, the researchers first genetically engineered prostate cancer cells that expressed higher levels of DLX1 protein to generate the cells which cannot produce the DLX1 protein. Both types of cancer cells were then implanted in two groups of mice. While mice that had received cancer cell implants expressing higher levels of the protein developed huge tumour, the mice that were implanted with DLX1-ablated cancer cells developed only small tumours, and had fewer cancer cells migrating to other organs. The second experiment on mice was to examine the ability of cancer cells to metastasis and grow in bones. \u201cProstate cancer cells have a tendency to metastasize in bones. So, we checked the role of DLX1 protein in cancer metastasis,\u201d says Goel. For this, they used cancer cells that were either DLX1-ablated or those expressing higher levels of the protein, and implanted the cancer cells into the tibia (bone) of the mice. A month after implant, the tumour growing in the tibia was monitored using CT scan. Mice implanted with cancer cells with elevated levels of DLX1 exhibited more bone damage than the cells that were DLX1-ablated. \u201cThese findings proved the role of DLX1 in prostate tumour growth and bone metastases,\u201d Goel says. Androgen receptor is responsible for promoting the development of prostate cancer. Also, about 50% of prostate cancer harbour an aberrant gene which is a product of two genes (TMPRSS2 and ERG) being fused together and results in production of higher levels of ERG protein. \u201cInterestingly, exploring the association between these important factors revealed that about 96% of TMPRSS2-ERG fusion-positive prostate cancer patients show high levels of DLX1 protein as well. In concert with this, about 70% of the patients with high androgen receptor signaling also have elevated DLX1 protein levels,\u201d says Prof. Ateeq. The researchers have further shown that both androgen receptor and fusion gene product, ERG are responsible for increased level of DLX1 in prostate cancer cells. Having understood the mechanism responsible for prostate cancer growth and development, and it\u2019s spread to distant organs, the researchers turned their attention to finding a way to reduce the expression of DLX1 protein in the cancer cells. They found that a particular protein (Bromodomain and extra terminal or BET) assists the function of both androgen receptor and ERG. \u201cWe found that if the BET protein is inhibited using small molecules, the function of both the androgen receptor and the ERG protein to upregulate DLX1 gets inhibited. As a result, the expression of the DLX1 protein and its tumorigenic potential is reduced,\u201d says Goel. Preclinical mice studies showed that administering BET inhibitors alone or in combination with anti-androgen drugs resulted in about 70% reduction in tumour burden along with diminished distant metastases. \u201cThose prostate cancer patients with higher levels of DLX1 may benefit by this treatment strategy. There are several commercially available diagnostics tests for detecting DLX1 levels, therefore it is relatively easy to categorize the patients who could respond to BET inhibitors,\u201d says Prof. Ateeq.

This was expected given that it ranks India 101 out of 116 countries for which reliable and comparable data exist. To add insult to injury, the GHI puts India far below some of its neighbouring countries. Barring\u00a0 last year\u2019s rank of 94 out of 107 countries, India\u2019s rank has been between 100 and 103 since 2017. This year\u2019s slide in the rank assumes significance especially in the context of COVID-19.  Is India\u2019s performance on hunger as dismal as denoted by the index or is it partly a statistical artefact? This question assumes immediacy, especially since the government has questioned the methodology and claimed that the ranking does not represent the ground reality. This calls for careful scrutiny of the methodology, especially of the GHI\u2019s components.  \n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Hunger Index | Only 3.9% children malnourished, says government\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \nGlobal Hunger Index | Only 3.9% children malnourished, says government\n The GHI has four components. The first \u2014 insufficient calorie intake \u2014 is applicable for all age groups, whereas the remaining three \u2014 wasting (low weight for height), stunting (low height for age) and mortality \u2014 are confined to children under five years. The data on deficiency in calorie intake, accorded 33% weight, is sourced from the Food and Agriculture Organization\u2019s Suite of Food Security Indicators (2021). Had the GHI been estimated using the latest data on calorie intake, usually provided by the National Sample Survey Office, things might have looked even worse given that the leaked report of 2019 indicated that consumption expenditure in India declined between 2011-12 and 2017-18 by 4%. In rural India, it was worse at about 10% per annum.  The data on child wasting and stunting (2016-2020), each accounting for 16.6% of weight, are from the World Health Organization, UNICEF and World Bank, complemented with the latest data from the Demographic and Health Surveys. Under-five mortality data are for 2019 from the UN Inter-Agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation. Contrary to what is being claimed by the government, the assessment of the situation of hunger is not based on the results of a \u2018four question\u2019 opinion poll, conducted telephonically by Gallup. However, this does not mean that the GHI is free from inadequacies. Conceptually, the GHI is largely children-oriented with a higher emphasis on undernutrition than on hunger and its hidden forms, including micronutrient deficiencies. The first component \u2014 calorie insufficiency \u2014 is problematic for many reasons. The lower calorie intake, which does not necessarily mean deficiency, may also stem from reduced physical activity, better social infrastructure (road, transport and healthcare) and access to energy-saving appliances at home, among others. Recent analysis establishes that \u2018physical disease environment\u2019 at the State level also significantly influences the calorie intake. For a vast and diverse country like India, using a uniform calorie norm to arrive at deficiency prevalence means failing to recognise the huge regional imbalances in factors that may lead to differentiated calorie requirements at the State level. From this vantage point, a large proportion of the population in Kerala and Tamil Nadu may get counted as calorie deficient despite them being better in nutritional outcome indicators. So, prevalence of calorie deficiency in these States may be overestimated. Also read | Global Hunger Index not based on an opinion poll, says German non-profit Welthungerhilfe Conversely, there are States that have a higher average level of calorie intake, such as Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, but their needs may even be higher than the earmarked level of required calories for India as a whole because these States have high prevalence of communicable diseases and low level of mechanisation in the economy. Thus, it is likely that the existing methodology might underestimate the prevalence of calorie deficiency in these States. All this raises questions on the appropriateness of the calorie component of the index. India\u2019s own official estimates of prevalence of calorie deficiency are not free from this anomaly. The GHI highlights India\u2019s dismal record in a domain that it can hardly defend, which is child undernutrition. India\u2019s wasting prevalence (17.3%) is one among the highest in the world. Its performance in stunting, when compared to wasting, is not that dismal, though. Child stunting in India declined from 54.2% in 1998\u20132002 to 34.7% in 2016-2020, whereas child wasting remains around 17% throughout the two decades of the 21st century. Stunting is a chronic, long-term measure of undernutrition, while wasting is an acute, short-term measure. Child wasting can manifest as a result of an immediate lack of nutritional intake and sudden exposure to an infectious atmosphere. Quite possibly, several episodes of wasting without much time to recoup can translate into stunting. However, a higher order of priority was accorded to stunting, both in research and policy, for the right reasons as it is a stable indicator and does not oscillate with minor changes in circumstances, while wasting does. Sporadic emergent circumstances in different regions may increase wasting prevalence. Effectively countering episodes of wasting resulting from such sporadic adversities is key to making sustained and quick progress in child nutrition. Thus, variations in wasting prevalence across the region should guide the relative emphasis of policy attention.  \n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernment slams \u2018methodology\u2019 after India\u2019s position tanks in Global Hunger Index\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \nGovernment slams \u2018methodology\u2019 after India\u2019s position tanks in Global Hunger Index\n If India can tackle wasting by effectively monitoring regions that are more vulnerable to socioeconomic and environmental crises, it can possibly improve wasting and stunting simultaneously. There seems to be no short-cut way of improving stunting without addressing wasting. Additionally, studies say that COVID-19 is likely to exacerbate child undernutrition in general and child wasting in particular. Such insights should have driven social policy to counter the adverse impacts of COVID-19 on food and nutrition insecurity. Unfortunately, India lost this opportunity as Integrated Child Development Scheme services were either non-functional or severely disrupted \u2014 partly because the staff and services were utilised to attend to the COVID-19 emergency. India\u2019s relatively better performance in the other component of GHI \u2014 child mortality \u2014 merits a mention. Studies suggest that child undernutrition and mortality are usually closely related, as child undernutrition plays an important facilitating role in child mortality. However, India appears to be an exception in this regard. India\u2019s child mortality rate has been lower compared to Sub-Saharan African countries despite it having higher levels of stunting. This implies that though India was not able to ensure better nutritional security for all children under five years, it was able to save many lives due to the availability of and access to better health facilities.   \n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nReimagining food systems with lessons from India\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \nReimagining food systems with lessons from India\n The low ranking does not mean that India fares uniformly poor in every aspect. Should we then dismiss the GHI as it shows India in a bad light and relegate it to political white noise because it does not suit us? Or should we gracefully accept its insights informing us that our performance in some aspects might actually be dismal and requires urgent attention and course correction? This ranking should prompt us to look at our policy focus and interventions and ensure that they can effectively address the concerns raised by the GHI, especially against pandemic-induced nutrition insecurity.

An eminent journalist also, he was an inspiration to writers and journalists in Assam. My heartfelt condolences to his family, friends & followers. Having lived not just a moderately long life, but a meaningfully productive one, Borgohain has left behind a massive body of work. He has to his credit five collections of short stories, thirteen novels and novellas, around fifty volumes of non-fictional prose, four books that are autobiographical, several edited volumes, and a single book of poems titled Hoimonti (1987). He won the Sahitya Akademi award in 1978 for his novel Pita-Putra (1999) but returned it in 2015 in protest against the Dadri lynching. Two of his other notable books of fiction, namely Matsyagandha (1987) and Halodhiya Soraiye Baodhan Khai (1973) were made into feature films, and the latter, directed by Jahnu Barua, won the national award in 1988. His Subala (1963) is notable not just for being the first ever work in Assamese literature on the life of a prostitute but also for being a decisive point in the development of post-war Assamese fiction, in the same rank as Birinchi Kumar Barua\u2019s Jibanar Batat (1945) in waking up Assamese fiction from its long hibernation. An esteemed journalist known for his thought-provoking and razor-sharp political writings, he was the founding editor of many weekly magazines like Nilachal (1968), Nagarik (1977), Samakal (1987), Sutradhar (1989). He also served as a special correspondent at the Calcutta-based daily Aajkaal, his work featuring in its North-East section, for a few years from 1981, where he wrote many pieces and was the first person from Assam to interview Mrs. Gandhi at length. In his own words, he studied each day of his life like a student who was preparing for his exams. When interviewed, he put it thus: \"I write two hours and read for two hours every day.\" This, in addition to the work he did in the capacity of a chief editor for various dailies, weeklies, and monthlies throughout his life. There is a word of Bengali origin in relation to music, 'riyaaz' \u2014 a constant honing of one's musical skills. Borgohain did that to his writing because he knew it required constant sharpening. To him the act of writing was what we call in Assamese neerab sadhana \u2014 quiet meditation \u2014 and he practised it rigorously, regularly and religiously so that the gift never left him. Hailing from the remote and backward village of Dhakuakhana in the Lakhimpur district of Assam, Borgohain was an example of what a man of humble origins and unexceptional looks (it made him suffer from inferiority complex during the Cotton College days as mentioned in his immensely popular autobiography Atmanusandhan) could achieve. He was an inspiration to generations of Assamese youth in the latter half of the twentieth century and beyond, most of whom forayed into the world of reading with his books. On his death, the Assamese as a people are almost chanting in unison, \u201cHe introduced us to the world of books. Our love for literature began with reading him.\u201d Not that the Assamese did not read before him, but the range and habits of reading changed substantially, a new reading public emerged from the lower and lower-middle classes. A voracious reader himself, he did in the world of Assamese letters what the medieval saints did to the sacred texts by translating them from classical languages to regional ones, thus decoding these for common people and making knowledge open to all. Borgohain popularised the form of the personal essay in Assam, and applied his wealth of reading into these pieces, combining personal experiences and moments of introspection with allusions to and anecdotes from the worlds of literature, philosophy, civilisational history, etc. The 154 personal essays collected in the three volumes of Mor Tokabahir Pora (Pages from My Notebook) have reserved their due place in the canon for posterity. The index of contents from one of his earliest collection of nonfictional prose called Ananda Aru Bedanar Sandhanat (In Search of Joy and Sorrow) introduces the masses to names like Jorge Luis Borges, Edgar Lee Masters, Goethe and Charlotte von Stein, Heinrich Heine, Dag Hammarskjold. He was not the intellectual\u2019s writer (although he had everything that it took to be one) but the people\u2019s writer. Like capsules, he packed knowledge in the simplest of forms, making it accessible to the masses, that too in a pre-Amazon and pre-ebooks era when not just readers but even bookshops were numbered. Borgohain had a gift for spotting fresh or obscure talent \u2014 and not just spotting but encouraging them onwards. Despite his busy schedule, he took time out to draft letters of appreciation to these young minds, sent for them from his office, or rang them up asking them to submit work. He provided platforms to new and emerging voices, put his faith in writers whose works were turned down by other leading magazines that played it safe by only publishing trusted and revered writers. While it is not unlikely that a senior and experienced writer anywhere in the world would help or guide aspirants in that field, what sets Borgohain apart from all of them is the sheer number of people he had helped take flight. In Assam at present, be it established or struggling writers, or journalists, academicians or intelligentsia, there may be few who, at one point or the other, had not been mentored by him or taken him as a role model. That measures the magnitude of the Borgohain effect. Immediately after the news of his demise spread, an old video of the stalwart has resurfaced, and has been doing the rounds, widely shared and forwarded in social media platforms. It is an interview where he is heard saying, \u201cTill my last breath I will keep labouring hard. Just as you extract the juice out of sugarcane until only the bagasse remains, I will work till the last drop of life is strained out of me so that when I discard the mortal flesh I am no more than bagasse [translation mine].\u201d And so he did. He remained active as the editor-in-chief of the Assamese daily Niyomiya Barta until his death, caused by post-Covid complications. What the Assamese as a race should remember and emulate is Homen Borgohain\u2019s proclivity for hard work. I would like to end this write-up with my translation of one of Borgohain\u2019s poems, \u2018Smriti\u2019 (Memory); more often than not death and art reveal their true merit only retrospectively. And all of a sudden, the familiar bird falls silent, \n The ripe fruit drops so silently \n The tree gets no hint of it; \n The fields turn desolate, the rats maddened by the scent of corn \n Silently vanish into the dark insides of a snake. \n \u00a0 \n The silent workings of Death is a primordial law of Nature. \n I, am its only, arrogant exception. \n When Death\u2019s infallible hand touches me \n A fierce cry of protest cracks my heart open. \n I look back again and again, a gory lament \n Piercing out my throat disturbs \n the ice-cold breeze of eternity, echoes endlessly. \n \u00a0 \n Because tied to my very essence is a memory undying \n of an endless time past and an unmapped time future, \n The impress of a beloved\u2019s face in the depths of the soul, \n through the pain of separation endlessly unfading. \n \u00a0 \n Memory is what is absent from the heart of Nature; \n And thus, I recreate Nature\u2019s old archetypes, \n The bright lamp-like words penetrate Death\u2019s infernal spread \n So that defying the laws of Nature my undying grief \n Can exercise its rights in another universe \n Where I am immortal, an eternal promise of Creation. \u00a0 * \u00a0 (Here is a list of Homen Borgohain\u2019s writings in English translation for those who do not read Assamese) \u00b7 The Collected Works of Homen Borgohain; translated by Pradipta Borgohain, Amaryllis, 2017. \u00b7 Astorag (Sunset).

India is also among the 31 countries where hunger has been identified as serious. India ranked 94 among 107 countries in the Global Hunger Index (GHI) released last year. Only 15 countries fare worse than India. These include Papua New Guinea (102), Afghanistan (103), Nigeria (103), Congo (105), Mozambique (106), Sierra Leone (106), Timor-Leste (108), Haiti (109), Liberia (110), Madagascar (111), Democratic Republic of Congo (112), Chad (113), Central African Republic (114), Yemen (115) and Somalia (116). India was also behind most of the neighbouring countries. Pakistan was placed at 92 rank, Nepal at 76 and Bangladesh also at 76. Current projections based on the Global Hunger Index (GHI) show that the world as a whole \u2014 and 47 countries in particular \u2014 will fail to achieve even low hunger by 2030. The Index tracks key indicators used to measure progress toward Zero Hunger by 2030 at national, regional, and global levels. Based on the values of the four indicators - undernourishment, child wasting, child stunting and child mortality- the GHI determines hunger on a 100-point scale, where 0 is the best possible score (no hunger) and 100 is the worst. Each country\u2019s GHI score is classified by severity, from low to extremely alarming. Somalia has the highest level of hunger according to the 2021 GHI ranking \u2014 its GHI score of 50.8 is considered extremely alarming, It is preceded by five countries with levels of hunger that are alarming \u2014 Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar, and Yemen \u2014 and 31 countries that have serious levels of hunger. \u201cAlthough GHI scores show that global hunger has been on the decline since 2000, progress is slowing. While the GHI score for the world fell 4.7 points, from 25.1 to 20.4, between 2006 and 2012, it has fallen just 2.5 points since 2012. After decades of decline, the global prevalence of undernourishment \u2014 one of the four indicators used to calculate GHI scores \u2014 is increasing. This shift may be a harbinger of reversals in other measures of hunger,\u201d says the report.

That the fashion world would adapt to it has been a revelation.  Most recently, we had the FDCI x Lakm\u00e9 Fashion Week \u2014 the first post-pandemic phygital show in India in the true sense of the word \u2014 featuring 11 on-ground physical shows (with online showcases), and digital previews. For those of us who find inspiration, freedom and livelihoods in the Indian fashion scene, this was good news.  \n\n\n\n\n\nTarun Tahiliani\u2019s set at FDCI x Lakm\u00e9 Fashion Week, Jio World Convention Centre\n\u00a0\n| Photo Credit: Vaqaas Mansuri \n\n\n\n\n Jio Convention Centre was the venue (FDCI x LFW was held as a pre-launch event for the space). It looked larger as the crowd was miniscule. The usual drinks lounges, media centres, and cafeterias were not a part of the plan. And with its high ceilings and tech-driven security, it was the safest I\u2019d felt in a public place in a while. Also read | Lakshmi Rana and 10 minutes of joy There was a strict mask, RT-PCR, and vaccination protocol to enter shows, and Neeraj Gaba, the show director, said, \u201cWe were tested every day for 12 days, quarantined alone before the physical shows began, and maintained security bubbles.\u201d The audience sat six feet apart, on individual chairs, in circles (gone are the days of fighting for a front row seat). But I missed the buzz of stylists, photographers, bloggers, editors and celebs hanging around shows and stalls. \n\n\n\n\n\nKareena Kapoor Khan and Gaurav Gupta at the FDCI x LFW finale \u2014 a drive-in show with an aquatic-themed set\n\u00a0\n| Photo Credit: Vaqaas Mansuri \n\n\n\n\n Many of us were seeing our peers for the first time since the start of the pandemic. There was hilarious confusion before greeting anyone \u2014 \u2018Are we hugging yet?\u2019 \u2014 and air kisses are now a proper fashion joke.

I can\u2019t come closer because we are in a bubble!\u201d When I asked her how the 2021 experience was, she replied, \u201cWalking on the ramp feels the same \u2014 the blinding lights and music make everything else disappear. But I miss the people.\u201d  While not officially on the FDCI x LFW roster, Vaishali S\u2019 bridal line, Shakuntala, was the first physical show I attended in 18 months, a day before fashion week officially began. At the Taj Mahal Palace hotel ballroom, it was Shadunglae\u2019s first outing in India after her Paris Couture Week debut in July. It featured signature cording technique on lehengas and fusion ensembles. Her commitment to indigenous weaves was commendable, but for some looks it did not translate well. \n\n\n\n\n\nTarun Tahiliani with the models before his show\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n In stark contrast \u2014 for the first day, first show \u2014 veteran couturier Tarun Tahiliani opened the calendar with a mind-boggling 78-ensemble show (with mini capsules of crafts). \u201cCommunity is of paramount importance; it became essential that we support, help, and guide each other,\u201d said Tahiliani, as he put a celebration of Indian karigari on full display. \u201cBoth FDCI and Lakm\u00e9 Fashion Week share a long-standing relationship with Tarun. It only felt natural to have him preview \u2018The Reunion\u2019, as both platforms returned to a joint phygital showcase,\u201d said Sunil Sethi, chairman of FDCI. There was so much to take in, but for me his chikankari expertise stood out. It was good to see some familiar faces on the catwalk, but sadly, yet again, I noticed only one plus-size model. The scene stealer across all the shows I watched was non-binary, queer model Tarun (from Mumbai-based FEAT agency). He has previously walked for Marni internationally, and flits easily between menswear and womenswear looks.  \n\n\n\n\n\nA model at the R | Elan x Abraham & thakore show\n\u00a0\n| Photo Credit: Vaqaas Mansuri \n\n\n\n\n Abraham and Thakore showcased their new line in collaboration with R|Elan, a mindful fabric company by Reliance. The fabrics are recycled (from PET bottles), but are still polyester. Are they \u2018sustainable\u2019, I wondered? \u201cSustainability cannot be looked at only from a yarn and fabric perspective,\u201d David Abraham told me over a call from Bengaluru. \u201cIf we are able to reuse existing material to remake something, to be used over a period of time, it fits in the circular fashion promise and is far more sustainable than creating something entirely new.\u201d  \n\n\n\n\n\nCoasters from Green Sutra\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n Also read | Wear a billboard, with some help from Bandit Another \u2018Sustainable Day\u2019 venture: Green Sutra.

FDCI X LFW partnered with them to collect used and discarded PET bottles, plastic packets, etc, and recycled them at the venue, before creating rustic but on-trend coasters and earrings for guests to take home. The organisers hinted at this being a long-term association, with a plan in place to record and implement the learnings. \u201cThere is no virtual medium that can replace the human experience, the jamming of people at actual events,\u201d Nishant Gadhok of Gently Altered \u2014 a company that elevates event experience via sound and light design \u2014 told me as he closed the finale.

She laughs at the question, but answers almost instantly. \u201cNo,\u201d she says, \u201cI would have definitely preferred the temple. If not for the temple, you wouldn\u2019t be sitting here and asking me questions.\u201d One might have to agree with her. Khushbu the star, is bigger than Khushbu the actress. She was the go-to heroine of the \u201890s. During that decade, she sometimes acted in over 10 films in a single year. That was probably enough to become a household name, an adjective for idli, and of course, the temple. Understandably, she values adoration more than awards. Also Read | Get \u2018First Day First Show\u2019, our weekly newsletter from the world of cinema, in your inbox. You can subscribe for free here Stardom is what she sought too. She had a taste of it very early. She was 10 when she debuted in BR Chopra\u2019s The Burning Train (1981). The film had Dharmendra, Hema Malini, Vinod Khanna, Parveen Babi, Jeetendra, Neetu Kapoor, Vinod Mehra, Navin Nischol and Danny Denzogpa. Going forward, she appeared in Bollywood till the late \u201880s, until she shifted predominantly to Tamil films. She grew up with the stars; it was natural that she wanted to become one as well. After sparkling through the \u201890s, the number of films reduced in the 2000s. Khushbu forayed into television, plunged into politics and had to take care of her children. She hardly appeared on the big screen after 2010. Today, even on smaller screens, we mostly see her as a politician. This year though, there will be a change. She will be in the Rajinikanth-starrer Annaathe (she does not want to call it a \u2018comeback\u2019 though). Khushbu will also be one of the judges in Colors Tamil\u2019s reality show, Dance vs Dance Season 2. In an interview, the actor-politician talks about her four-decade-old film career, reuniting with Rajinikanth in Annaatthe, the significance of dance in Tamil movies and more. Excerpts: Congratulations on completing four decades in films! Thank you. It\u2019s been a roller-coaster ride, and I think that\u2019s why I loved every bit of it. If not for the ups and downs, I might have easily gotten disinterested. In this journey, you have been a child artist, a female lead, show host, reality TV judge, producer, politician... which of these roles were your favourite? Being a mother. That has been my most favorite role. I didn\u2019t know anything except films and television. So this is what my life has been. Now, of course, I have become a politician. I had to cut down on films and TV because politics requires a lot of time and attention. And I look forward to being better at it. You\u2019re a judge on a dance reality show now. In the 80s and 90s, almost every Tamil movie had a dance number. It\u2019s not the case now. Do you think dance could slowly fade out of mainstream cinema? Dance in cinema is never going to fade away; it\u2019s part and parcel of cinema. We have had people like Vyjayanthimala ji and Puppy ma (Padmini). The generation just before me had excellent dancers like Jaya Prada, Jayasudha, Sridevi, Sripriya akka. I was a huge fan of Ambika\u2019s dancing.  After my generation, there have been a lot of good dancers too. You need to know how to dance; you can\u2019t have two left feet and say \u2018I want to be a great actress.\u2019 Yes, maybe in an OTT film, you might not need to dance. But to at least emote on screen, you need to have a sense of rhythm. But unless you know what music is about, what dancing is about, you cannot even take two steps into acting.  Favourite dance numbersRum Bum Bum (Michael Madana Kama Rajan), Per vachalum Vaikama Ponalum (Michael Madana Kama Rajan), Illavattam Kai Thattum (My Dear Marthandan), Satham Varamal (My Dear Marthandan), Metro Channel (Indhu), Kotta Paakkum Kozhundhu Veththalaiyum (Nattamai), Otha Rooba (Naattu Purapaatu) But do you see dance choreographers retaining their significance in Tamil cinema in this era? Definitely. It\u2019s not just about the dance steps; choreographers know how to take the story forward. They understand the situation of the song, the emotion it tries to convey. A song essentially says a story in four minutes. My husband (Sundar C), for instance, cannot do without someone like Brindha. The same goes for someone like Mr Mani Ratnam. As long as you have cinema, there will be choreographers around. \n\n\n\n\n\nKhushbu with Brindha Gopal\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n Compared to your time, there are more roles written for women in Tamil cinema. Is now a better time for actresses? Yes. We have seen OTT platforms, especially during the pandemic, offering a vast space to make different kinds of films. The competition is really tough. Now, people can watch films from other languages. Malayalam cinema, for instance, is at a different level. We need to keep up with them and give better roles for women. A lot of things have changed from my time. You have the OTTs and multiplexes. You have a different kind of audience who are ready to accept different kinds of cinema. But big films still remain hero-oriented films. The heroine-oriented films aren\u2019t making a huge impact at the box-office... You are going to act with Rajinikanth after a long time in Annaatthe\u2026 I am not supposed to be talking anything about Annaathe. But it\u2019s going to be a fun film. People will get to see the Rajinikanth they always wanted to see. It will be like the Rajinikanth from Annamalai, Arunachalam, Muthu, and Padayappa. That Rajinikanth was missing for a very long time. Meena and I have cute roles to play in it. There are multiple theories on social media on what it would be. But it will be a nice surprise.

Meena and I were holding back a little to talk to Rajini sir, because we were working with him after a long time. I was not sure how he would react. People change, you know?

But the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted a few spells of rain or thundershowers in the next few days to tame the mercury. Guwahati recorded an average of 37.07\u00b0C over three days till October 16, when most cities in the north-east registered a temperature of 4-5 degrees higher than usual. Arunachal Pradesh capital Itanagar was the hottest on October 16 at 37.8\u00b0C followed by Tripura capital Agartala at 34.8\u00b0C, Mizoram capital Aizawl at 29.2\u00b0C, Manipur capital Imphal at 28.8\u00b0C, Nagaland capital Kohima at 26.5\u00b0C, and Meghalaya capital Shillong at 26.2\u00b0C. IMD officials said a day or two in October could have been hotter in the past 50 years, but the high temperature has unusually persisted over a longer period this time. \u201cThe rise in temperature is due to a low pressure system in the Bay of Bengal. There is less moisture because of the low pressure, resulting in this dry weather,\u201d said Sunit Das, a meteorologist at the IMD\u2019s Regional Meteorological Centre. \u201cBut the temperature is set to go down with rain or thundershower likely in the next three-four days,\u201d he said. According to the IMD, Assam experienced a monsoon with 22% deficit rainfall. The rainfall deficit in the other six contiguous north-eastern States ranged from 21-30%. The meteorologists said it would be difficult to attribute the dip in rainfall and an \u201cextended summer\u201d to climate change. \u201cData of all the meteorological centres over a substantial period of time need to be analysed to come to a conclusion,\u201d a weather specialist said.

Vidyut Mohan led Takachar was named the winner of the GBP 1 million prize for its cheap technology innovation to convert crop residues into sellable bio-products in the \u201cclean our air\u201d category. It was among five worldwide winners of the prize, created by Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, to reward people trying to save the planet. \u201cTime is running out. A decade doesn\u2019t seem long enough, but humankind has an outstanding record of being able to solve the unsolvable,\u201d Prince William said in a recorded message played at the ceremony, which was broadcast on BBC and attended by celebrities and included performances by singers Ed Sheeran and Coldplay. Takachar was named a winner for its technology which reduces smoke emissions by up to 98%, aimed at helping improve the air quality that currently reduces the affected population\u2019s life expectancy by up to five years. If scaled, it could cut a billion tonnes of carbon dioxide a year, described as \u201ca win for India\u2019s farmers will be a win in the fight against climate change\u201d. \u201cTakachar has developed a cheap, small-scale, portable technology that attaches to tractors in remote farms. The machine converts crop residues into sellable bio-products like fuel and fertilizer,\u201d the Earthshot Prize notes in reference to the winning project. It adds, \u201cGlobally, we generate $120 billion of agricultural waste every year. What farmers cannot sell, they often burn, with catastrophic consequences for human health and the environment. The burning of agricultural waste causes air pollution that in some areas has reduced life expectancy by a decade. \u201cThis plays out every year in the fields surrounding New Delhi. Smoke from man-made infernos fills the air, with serious consequences for the health of locals. One of their number is Vidyut Mohan. His social enterprise, Takachar, is putting out the fire.\u201d Takachar went head to head with another Indian finalist in the category \u2014 14-year-old Tamil Nadu schoolgirl Vinisha Umashankar\u2019s solar-powered ironing cart project. The final five winners were connected to the eco-friendly awards ceremony by global broadcast, and no celebrities flew to London for the ceremony, no plastic was used to build the stage. Guests were asked to \u201cconsider the environment\u201d when choosing an outfit, with actor Emma Watson walking the green carpet in a dress made from 10 different dresses from Oxfam. The Earthshot Prize\u2019s name is a reference to the \u201cMoonshot\u201d ambition of 1960s America, which saw then-President John F. Kennedy pledge to get a man on the Moon within a decade. Each year for the next decade, the prize is awarding GBP 1 million each to five projects that are working to find solutions to the planet\u2019s environmental problems. The inaugural winners were selected from five different categories and were chosen from a shortlist of 15 by judges including broadcaster Sir David Attenborough, actress Cate Blanchett and singer Shakira. Costa Rica emerged as the winner in the \u201cprotect and restore nature\u201d category for a scheme paying local citizens to restore natural ecosystems that has led to a revival of the rainforest. A project run by two best friends who are growing coral in the Bahamas designed to restore the world\u2019s dying coral reefs won the prize in the \u201crevive our oceans\u201d category. A waste-busting initiative from Milan, Italy, won in the \u201cbuild a waste-free world\u201d and a renewable energy project to make hydrogen by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen from Thailand, Germany and Italy won in the \u201cfix our climate category\u201d. Each winner was awarded a one-of-a-kind prize medal, designed by award-winning Dutch artist Christien Meindertsma, inspired by the iconic \u2018Earthrise\u2019 photo taken of the earth from space from the Apollo 8 mission in 1968 and created from recycled materials. All 15 finalists will receive tailored support from the Earthshot Prize Global Alliance, a network of philanthropies, NGOs and private sector businesses around the world who will help scale their solutions. The London awards ceremony concluded by revealing the Earthshot Prize will travel to the U.S. in 2022, with nominations for the 2022 prize to open in January.

Keep them at bay this rainy season by making friends with a Western concept: the mudroom. Historically, mudrooms were born in rural settings where roads were unpaved and boots were perennially muddy. The result? Wet footprints, mud on the floor, and very often boot tracks through the home.  Mudrooms were typically seen in farmhouses in the 18th century and more often than not were a small closet-like space off the kitchen or at the entryway. By the 1970s, many homes in the West had such areas which were usually located between the garage and the kitchen.  Indian homes and mudrooms don\u2019t really go back a long way but there\u2019s no reason that they shouldn\u2019t. Especially not in the monsoon! Try out these easy tips to transform a small entryway or verandah into a mudroom this season.  \n\n\n\n\n\n A mudroom has certain specific functions; it\u2019s the small entryway where footwear and outer clothes can be removed and placed before entering the home. Place a coat stand for wet raincoats, a mesh umbrella stand for dripping umbrellas and a stone-lined tray for slushy shoes.  Function should never detract from the form; so what if it\u2019s just the humble mudroom? Simple or elegant, a few d\u00e9cor elements will transform this space into a welcoming and warm one. Add a mirror for last-minute touch-ups.  No mudroom can do without a bench. This piece of furniture works in myriad ways \u2014 you can perch yourself to wear or take off your shoes, put down your shopping bag or sit to take a call. Make it a space-intensive area by creating room to put shoes underneath.  Children are the ones who love to wade in muddy puddles and it\u2019s important that you kit out the mudroom to suit them. Avoid closets and cupboards; low-hanging hooks for rain coats and a boot stand are ideal. The flooring should be anti-skid, so look for options to avoid accidents.   Where kids are, clutter seems to follow. Keep your mudroom organised and clutter-free, by making the space as functional and efficient as you can. Double up the hook rows; you can use one for hanging rain gear and the other for bags. Bring in a set of bins or baskets if space permits. It allows everyone to have a designated space for their things.  \n\n\n\n\n\n Mudrooms are not really rooms; they\u2019re usually little nooks or niches. Make the most of the small square footage by exploring the vertical dimension with shelves, closets and cubbies. You\u2019ll have enough storage and a neat mudroom. Could you ask for anything more? Make your mudroom the best go-to spot from your home. A couple of charging points to get your phone ready to go, a key organiser and a catchall for your sunglasses will ensure that you\u2019re out of your home without forgetting a thing.  The mudroom may be a foreign concept, but it\u2019s one that can be adopted by almost any family. The best part is that it can serve different purposes for different families.  Use it to stash your purses, bags, raincoats, and sports gear. A series of racks, hooks, and hangers can help optimise storage options, keep clutter out of the other rooms, and ensure that all your things are organised better.  Also, the addition of accessories such as a bulletin board or a chalkboard can help draw up schedules for all family members, ensuring that everyone\u2019s on the same page.

The coal shortage has impacted power generation in many states, including Gujarat, Punjab, Rajasthan, Delhi and Tamil Nadu. But power shortages have so far been mostly restricted to northern states. Chief ministers of some states have even written to the Prime Minister about the imminent power crisis faced by the States. What has caused the coal shortage and power crisis? Power plants are grappling with a surge in demand from industries as India's economy is picking up after the second wave of COVID-19. Power consumption in the last two months alone jumped by almost 17%, compared to the same period in 2019. As there is a reluctance to raise the price that consumers pay for electricity, power plants have very little incentive to boost production. As for coal, domestic producers are unable to meet the rise in demand despite India having the fourth largest reserves in the world. India is the world's second-largest importer of coal after China. But importing coal has also become hard, because international coal prices have hit record highs due to the increase in global demand.\u00a0  What is the coal ministry saying? The Coal Ministry said coal supplies in India were set to hit a \u2018record high\u2019 in 2021-2022, it blamed extended monsoons for constraints in despatches from mines.  The Power Ministry\u00a0 has asked States to utilise unallocated power of the central generating stations to meet the requirements of their own consumers. What can be done? The coal shortage and power crisis comes at a time when India has been trying to reduce its dependence on coal to meet climate targets. In 2016, India committed to cut emissions by 33% by 2030 and to ensure that about 40% of its installed power capacity comes from renewable energy, targets that the government says it is on track to reach.  But the country\u2019s 135 coal-fired power plants supply about 70% of India\u2019s electricity. As a long-term solution, experts advocate an investment in multiple power sources, a mix of coal and clean sources of energy.

We were pretty much written off. \u201cSo, there is a little bit of satisfaction around that and a lot of pride in what the players have been able to achieve and maintain the standards over a number of months and that was a challenge for an ageing side,\u201d added the former New Zealand skipper. Commenting on the team\u2019s philosophy, Fleming pointed out the importance of experience, in a format that is widely believed is for youth, as the key behind the team\u2019s consistency. \u201cWe have things we believe in and we pick players who can fill roles. We have got some outstanding leaders and experienced players. People call them old, but I call them experienced and that helps create an environment that is very calm and understands what it is doing,\u201d he said.

Dhoni will play for Chennai Super Kings in the IPL next season. But I have not spoken to him on the subject yet,\u201d said Chennai Super Kings CEO K.S. Viswanathan after a triumphant campaign. Speaking to The Hindu from Dubai on Sunday, Viswanathan spoke about Dhoni\u2019s leadership qualities and big match temperament. \u201cOur team meetings were very brief. They did not last more than two minutes; you would not believe this. Yet Dhoni managed to convey to every player what his role was,\u201d revealed Viswanathan. And it was Dhoni\u2019s idea to start the CSK camp in Dubai early. \u201cThis really helped the team,\u201d observed Viswanathan. About Dhoni, despite lack of runs, arriving before Ravindra Jadeja and conjuring a match-winning cameo against Delhi Capitals in Qualifier 1, Viswanathan said, \u201cHe has this big match temperament. He backs himself to deliver.\u201d Viswanathan said, \u201cRemember we have reached nine finals and won four of them. Our victory in 2018 was special because we were coming back.\u201d He added, \u201cWe lost narrowly in the final in 2019. 2020 was a bad year, the law of averages caught up with us. To bounce back from that and lift the Trophy in 2021 is hugely satisfying.\u201d \u201cAge was only a number,\u201d Viswanathan said and spoke about criticism from some quarters after CSK bought Robin Uthappa. He said, \u201cThey said Uthappa was 35 and we are again signing an older player. But we knew Uthappa had experience and was a match-winner. His knocks in Qualifier-1 and final were crucial.\u201d Asked whether CSK would rebuild from the next auction, Viswanathan did not commit himself. \u201cOnly after we receive the rules for the auction that we will decide on our strategy.\u201d Viswanathan had words of praise for the net bowlers. \u201cBowlers like Tushar Deshpande, Tanvir-ul-Haq, Mukesh Chaudhary, Rakshan Reddy, and bowlers from the MRF Pace Foundation, really helped our batsmen prepare.\u201d On the opening combination of Ruturaj Gaikwad and Faf du Plessis, Viswanathan said, \u201cWe always knew Ruturaj was a special player. And Faf is a proven customer, who performs when the chips are down.\u201d He appreciated the effort from the bowlers. \u201cIf you do not pick wickets, you are not in the game. Josh Hazlewood is a very good red ball bowler. We picked him because we felt if someone is such a capable red ball bowler, he should be good with the white ball too. Hazlewood proved us right. \u201cRavindra Jadeja is a match-winner with the bat, ball and on the field. Shardul Thakur was a bit expensive but picked vital wickets. Moeen Ali hit the ball a long way and chipped in with the ball when the conditions were right. \u201cWe will be going for title No. 5 in the next edition,\u201d concluded Viswanathan.

Considering the challenges of the pandemic, it becomes imperative that we empathise with students and help them understand that, to be successful, it is more important to enjoy the phase of board exams than to get stressed. The need of the hour is to become a learning, thinking, skilled individual who can collaborate, communicate and create, as opposed to just focus on marks. Board exam is not a destination, but merely a phase. Ensure that students get into a healthy routine of studies backed with smart goals balanced with extracurricular activities.  Practice is key They must solve practice papers and previous papers regularly. Being aware of and understanding the current guidelines and patterns is essential. Mind maps on various topics will come in handy during revision. Timely completion and submission of work is important as it reduces stress and builds confidence.  Study need not always be solitary. A well-planned group study has a lot of benefits as peer teaching/learning is effective and hence should be encouraged. Set realistic goals and celebrate every achievement, however small. Eventually, the focus should shift to quality of work.  Break the stereotype of being successful in terms of marks and select careers. Instead, make them understand the need for why something should be learnt. If they can relate the learning to the application in real life, then, automatically their performance will improve. Ensure that they know that they are loved, cared for and their opinions valued irrespective of their marks. Talk about mental health and peer pressure. Reach out to support groups for counselling. A healthy diet and sleep routine is equally important. Studying for long hours does not guarantee success; instead, it could cause fatigue. A focused approach is more beneficial; if necessary, set a time-table with a variety of subjects and timings. This will help break the monotony.  Finally, learning is a lifelong journey. It doesn\u2019t end with marks and exams. Any roadblock should be taken as an opportunity.

The protests by the local residents have been growing with each passing Friday and the administration\u2019s efforts to find an amicable solution by bringing both parties to a negotiation table have proved to be futile so far. Several local residents, including women, assembled at the site for a Jumma Namaz this past Friday as well pre-empting the Namazis, chanting Hanuman Chalisa and playing bhajans on a hand-held portable music system. Holding placards against Namaz in the open, they soon began to march towards the Namazis, but the police, deployed at the site, hurriedly intervened to stop them. The protesters then turned to the local news channels and print media journalists at the site accusing the police and the administration of taking sides and vowed to return again next Friday in greater strength. Spearheading the protests, local councillor Kuldeep Yadav argued that the residents were not against any religion, but opposed to the gathering of \u2018outsiders\u2019 in their residential area. He also argued that the site was earmarked for a market and the same should be constructed at the earliest. Sector 47 RWA president Sunil Yadav, holding a bunch of papers, claimed that the permission to hold Jumaa Namaaz at the said ground was granted only for a day in 2018, and it was being continued illegally. He also objected to the fact that the administration designated the place for holding Namaz without the consent of the local residents. A few protesters also alleged that the identity of the Namazis was not known and they posed a \u201csecurity threat\u201d. In two rounds of meetings held between the two parties with the initiative of the administration and the police this past week, the local residents have demanded that the place of Namaz be shifted outside Sector 47 and suggested an open space near Subhash Chowk as an alternate. Altaf Ahmad, part of the talks on behalf of his community, said the site was designated by the administration for holding Namaz and shifting to another place without a valid reason made little sense. \u201cThe locals have no valid reason in asking us to shift to another place. And it is not going to help in any way because the protests are not about the place but are aimed at the community itself. The local authorities had designated 30-odd places for Namaz after protests by a few Hindu groups against Namaz in the open in 2018. But there were renewed protests since March this year led by Dinesh Bharti, head of Bharat Mata Vahini. He succeeded in stopping Jumma Namaaz at Sector 39, 40 and 43 during March and April. The community registered an FIR against him on April 16, however he remains undeterred,\u201d said Mr. Ahmad, also co-founder, Gurgaon Nagrik Ekta Manch, a civil society group working for communal harmony in the city. He alleged that the protests at Sector 47 for the past one month was not a case in isolation, but a part of a \u201cbigger conspiracy\u201d. Mr. Kuldeep Yadav, however, refuted the allegations saying that they had nothing to do with the protests against Namaz elsewhere in the city. Aman Yadav, ACP, Sadar Bazar, said efforts were on to find a solution and two rounds of meetings were already held. Mr. Yadav told the media that there was neither any \u2018information\u2019 nor any \u201cformal complaint\u201d of eve-teasing or any crime at this site. He said fake news was being spread through social media to vitiate the atmosphere and action had been taken against such people in the past. Ritu Raj, Shiv Sena spokesperson, Haryana, said the administration had in 2018 agreed to gradually bring down the number of designated Namaz places and remove parks and public places from the list, but it was not done. Countering his claims, Mr. Ahmad said the administration had in 2018 brought down the number of open places for Namaz to 30-odd, including three mosques, from around 100 earlier. \u201cIn fact, the administration had assured us in 2018 that the list of Jumma places can be increased once the dust settles and the negotiators gave into the request of the administration,\u201d he claimed. Deputy Leader of the Congress Legislative Party and Nuh MLA Aftab Ahmed also wrote to Chief Minister Manohar Lal earlier this month seeking his intervention in the matter and direction to the local authorities to deal strictly with the troublemakers disrupting the Friday prayers. The former Haryana Transport Minister, in his letter, said such incidents had been on the rise in the State for the past few years. Lack of mosques to cater to the growing Muslim population, both residential and floating, especially in New Gurugram, adds another dimension to the problem.  Thanks to growing job opportunities, both for high-skill and low-skill jobs in the Millennium City, the Muslim population has increased over the past decade and is estimated to be around five lakhs. But there are only two mosques \u2014 Anjuman Jama Masjid, Sector 57 and Rajiv Chowk Masjid \u2014 in New Gurugram to cater to the growing population. While the capacity of Anjuman Masjid is just 400, the Rajiv Chowk Masjid is under litigation and further construction is not permitted. \u201cThe Muslim community applied for mosques at three separate sites in Sector 43, 50 and 52 in 2016, however, after the interviewing process was completed, the administration rejected all our applications and gave the earnest money back to us. We have again applied in October,\u201d said Mr. Ahmad. One of the members of the Gurgaon Nagrik Ekta Manch said the series of events over the past few years including the protests against the Jumma Namaz in open in 2018, targeting of meat shops during Navaratri, and more recently a public meeting in Patadui targeting the minority community and now the renewed protests seemed connected and aim to keep the issue on the boil. \u201cMost of these incidents are individual leaders driven...there are people who want to become leaders through it. But there also seems a tactic support from behind. To me, these are small experiments to see the kind of impact these create. If it works and gets attention, it gets more support. While the incidents in 2018 were held in the run-up to the Lok Sabha and the Vidhan Sabha elections, these protests now are happening at a time when the farmers protests are going on at the Delhi borders,\u201d said the member, not willing to be identified.

What we\u2019re trying to do with the new Plus catalogue is to deliver more value to our subscribers, including those who\u2019re prolific consumers of more established forms of media, like streaming.\u201d He added that the category is growing at the speed of knots in India. \u201cFor Audible, India has been one of the fastest-growing markets in its history. Our most engaged listeners are tuned in for over two-and-a-half hours per day, and what we\u2019ve found through their insights and surveys is that they have found ways to incorporate Audible into their daily lives \u2014 people are now listening to audio stories and podcasts while engaged in their daily lives, their jobs.\u201d According to industry studies, the last couple of years and the more recent pandemic-induced lockdowns have led to people spending more time with audio books \u2014 the average weekly consumption has risen from seven to 16 hours. \u201cThere are a number of proof points from various surveys and studies assessing audiobook and podcast consumption, from PWC, KPMG and so on, that tell us there\u2019s so much room to grow here,\u201d adds Sawlani.

Sasural Wonder Phool, for example, is a Hindi-language romantic comedy starring Sanya Malhotra (Shakuntala Devi, Photograph) and Varun Malhotra (Fukrey), set in a family that runs a sex clinic. Romance novelist Durjoy Datta\u2019s The Last Girl to Fall in Love is another Hindi-language story set in the pandemic, voiced by actors Anupriya Goenka and Akshay Oberoi. \n\n\n\n\n\n Soon, we might get to listen to these performers as they adapt your favourite international audio stories into Indian languages(like the aforementioned The Sandman Hindi series). \u201cWe\u2019re always on the lookout for stories from around the world that we feel would do well irrespective of language. We have recently released Buri Nazar, which is an adaptation of a popular Audible title, Evil Eye. Through the industry we know of several franchises that are being localised, to cater to regional-language listeners,\u201d says Sawlani, who is quick to add, \u201cThere are a lot of things in motion that we can\u2019t talk about today.

Jaishankar on October 17 met with the Indian Jewish community in Israel and hailed their manifold contribution to the ties between the two countries. Mr. Jaishankar, who arrived in Jerusalem earlier in the day, said he was confident that the Indian Jewish community in Israel will bring the two countries even closer together in the coming years. \u201cThis is my third visit to Israel in the last four years. But every time I return, I leave with the sense of an unfinished journey. Like India, this too is a place that requires a lifetime to discover and understand. I am, therefore, happy to be back here, in a land with which we have centuries old ties, and amidst you who are the umbilical cord nourishing these ties,\u201d Mr. Jaishankar said addressing the Indian Jewish community in Israel and a gathering of Indologists. Mr. Jaishankar sentiments previously echoed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi that India\u2019s relationship with its Jewish diaspora community in Israel is one of \u201cmutual trust and friendship\u201d. The Jewish diaspora in India remains unique because \u201clike other communities it coexisted peacefully in India for hundreds of years but maintained its Jewish identity despite a long isolation from other Jewish communities\u201d, the Minister said. \u201cAnd, two, you chose to begin a new life here mainly for civilizational reasons. And it is rare in Jewish history that you have had a long, continuous period where you thrived in freedom and equality, as you did in India,\u201d he stressed. Citing ancient connections between the two civilisations \u2014 both cultural and religious, Mr. Jaishankar applauded the contribution of Indian Jews in the nation building process of India, describing them as \u201cone of us\u201d. The central text of Rabbinic Judaism, Talmud, mentions trade with India in ginger and iron. Another foremost religious text, The Book of Esther, mentions India as Hodu. \u201cYou have contributed to the building of India. We often go around Mumbai and Pune not realising that many landmarks were your contributions, like the Sassoon Docks in Mumbai and the Sassoon Hospital in Pune. David Sassoon was, in fact, one of the founders of the Bank of India. \u201cSome of you were by the side of Mahatma Gandhi during our freedom struggle. In 1916, one of the lawyers in the team defending one of our major nationalist leaders, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, was a Jew, David Erulkar,\u201d Mr. Jaishankar said. \u201cSome of you contributed as educators and some as medical doctors, like Dr. Jerusha Jhirad who was awarded one of our highest civilian awards, the Padma Shri. Some of you served as administrators and some distinguished themselves in our judiciary, such as David Reuben who served as the Chief Justice of one of our High Courts. There were three among you who became Mayors of Bombay. And there were another three who are remembered for their military service; Vice Admiral J.R. Samson, Maj. Gen. B.A. Samson, and Lt. Gen. J.F.R. Jacob whose uniform hangs at the Latrun Museum here,\u201d he said. Mr. Jaishankar went on to to highlight the community\u2019s contributions in enriching India\u2019s literature and arts with the likes of Nissim Ezekiel who was honoured with the Sahitya Akademi award. \u201cPeople of my generation grew up in India waking up to the signature tune of the All India Radio that had been composed by a Jewish exiled in India, Walter Kauffman. And how can you be in India and remain untouched by Bollywood and cricket! You have been part of our film industry and one of you, Judah Reuben, officiated as cricket umpire in many of India\u2019s test matches,\u201d he reminisced. The continuity of age-old Indian practices by the Jewish community received particular appreciation from the Minister, which he saw as creating \u201cthe organic bond between our two peoples\u201d. \u201cWhat is equally important and interesting is that not only have you, again inevitably, carried some flavours of India with you here, but also that you have retained, or assimilated in some form, some Indian traditions in a manner that is unique to you,\u201d Mr. Jaishankar said. In culinary, the Minister pointed out the \u2018Malida thali\u2019 made by the Bene Israelis (Indian Jews from the Maharashtra region). He spoke on the influence of the \u2018mangalsutra\u2019 and \u2018mehendi\u2019, the practice of \u2018baat pukka\u2019 for formalising marriages among Baghdadi Jews, and symbolic adorning of the Torah arks with jasmine garlands and the use of \u2018manara\u2019 by the Cochini Jews as some such examples. \u201cYou also adopted that very Indian tradition of removing shoes before entering the synagogue. You still remember our way of life, our languages, and our festivals. I am told about the Maiboli journal in Marathi. And I recently saw pictures of many of you celebrating Onam with a \u2018saadya\u2019 meal, not to forget the flower rangoli. You celebrate both Holi and Purim, and both Diwali and Hanukkah,\u201d he further added. \u201cIt is, therefore, not at all surprising that so many of you say [that] Israel is my fatherland and India my motherland,\u201d Mr. Jaishankar emphasised. Addressing Indologists, the Minister said that \u201cwe owe a debt of gratitude for their love and affection for India\u201d which has helped strengthen ties between the two countries. \u201cYou serve to both widen and deepen the discourse between one holy land and another. There are, among you, those who have delved deep into Dravidian languages and literature, translated classical Sanskrit texts into Hebrew, devoted themselves to the study of Hindi literature, and even ventured into comparative studies of the two religions,\u201d he noted. The Minister mentioned India\u2019s historic connection with Jerusalem going back to Sufi Saint baba Farid meditating in a cave inside the city walls around 1200 CE, the role of Indian soldiers in the region during World War I and how some of these soldiers also ensured the safety of the spiritual leader of the Baha\u2019i Faith in Israel at that time. \u201cIn modern post-Independence times, there\u2019s also this relatively less known aspect of how major socialist political leaders and streams in India felt a kinship with the kibbutz movement in Israel, in a quest to build on the Gandhian concept of ashram or village as a self-sustaining unit of development,\u201d he noted. Bringing out some of the lesser known connections between people of the two countries, he shared that \u201cJayaprakash Narayan, one of our most prominent political leaders and theorists associated with our Independence struggle, visited Israel in 1958, and many followers of Vinoba Bhave, another towering leader of our independence movement, visited Israel in 1960 to understand the kibbutz movement better\u201d. The strong connection, he said, also brings the urgent need to tap both the community and the Indologists here to better document the heritage and history of the community, as also the societal crossflows. \u201cHow do we preserve the memory and experiences of the community elders? How do we listen to the younger generation of the community, understand their aspirations and make them a part of our living bridge? How do we enhance the reach of the work being done by the Indologists both within the community and outside?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe would be happy to hear from you and support endeavours in this direction. I am told that the Embassy has already offered to devote a corner in its Cultural Center to house the work being done by you so that it is both available and accessible in one place,\u201d he noted. Mr. Jaishankar also launched a book by Prof. Shaul Shapir, \u201cBombay/Mumbai: City Heritage Walks\u201d. Sapir, an India born scholar, was a Professor at the prestigious Hebrew University of Jerusalem. The book outlines the excellent way to discover the city\u2019s old Colonial architectural gems and to enjoy a glimpse of the glory of the city in the days of the British Raj. The publication includes 14 city walks, 15 easy to follow maps, 123 historical, architectural heritage landmarks and sites, 850 notes and sources, and more than 1,000 photographs. \u201cVery pleased to meet the Indian Jewish community in Israel. Valued their manifold contribution to India-Israel ties. Confident that they will bring us even closer together in the coming years,\u201d Mr. Jaishankar tweeted after his interaction with the Indian Jewish community. During his visit, the minister would call on President Isaac Herzog, Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and Foreign Minister Yair Lapid. He will also be holding talks with leading academics from all over Israel, business community leaders and interacting with the Indian Jewish community. Mr. Jaishankar will also be visiting places of historical significance to India, demonstrating its long-term presence in the region and constructive role played in shaping the history of the region. India and Israel elevated bilateral relations to a strategic partnership during the historic visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Israel in July 2017. Since then, the relationship between the two countries has focused on expanding knowledge-based partnership, which includes collaboration in innovation and research, including boosting the \u2018Make in India\u2019 initiative, the Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement ahead of his departure.

born on October 17, 1817. That was a long time ago, but his thought process is as relevant today as ever before. With the new National Education Policy, the role of education in national integration has been rekindled. National integration is a reality today. During colonialism, it was an ideal for Sir Syed. His distinctiveness lay in the way he used education as a tool for national integration. He said in 1883: \u201cIt is the... verdict of all the nations and great seers of the world that national progress depends on education and training (of the people). If, therefore, we desire the prosperity and development of our nation, we should strive for a national system of education to educate our people in science and technology.\u201d  \n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018Sir Syed unfailingly stood for all Indians\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \n\u2018Sir Syed unfailingly stood for all Indians\u2019\n Some scholars on colonial history have criticised some of Sir Syed\u2019s statements on social order and his perceived closeness with the colonial government. However, to draw a generalised conclusion on Sir Syed\u2019s convictions merely through the lens of some quotes without understanding their context would not be a fair way to assess his legacy. A person\u2019s text should be judged in the context of the time in which they lived. The period of Sir Syed\u2019s life was characterised by rapid transition \u2014 Mughal rule yielding to British imperialism. We must not underestimate the challenges posed by the new order for someone brought up in the old order. Sir Syed embraced change against all the odds. When Sir Syed started his project of educational renaissance, he invited all Indians to come together to join hands in the struggle against illiteracy. This arose from his wish to unshackle Hindus and Muslims from medieval thinking towards broad-mindedness, reason and progress. It is critical to understand that while his approach always remained inclusive, he gave special attention to Muslims as Hindus had embarked to the path to scientific education much earlier than Muslims. It is a known fact that the debate on the tension between religion and science had settled earlier among Hindus than Muslims. Sir Syed laid out his vision for Hindu-Muslim unity in a speech in January 1883 where he said, \u201cIndia is like a bride which has got two beautiful and captivating eyes \u2014 Hindus and Muslims. Within the ranks of the Hindus or Muslims themselves, or even between brothers as also between fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, there is dissension. But to make it perennial is a symptom of the decay of the family, the country, and of the nation.\u201d The bonhomie between the two communities has always existed since the inception of the Mohammedan Anglo-Oriental (MAO) College, the precursor of AMU. This was not a small task. During colonial rule, a narrative of hatred had been engineered by the British. Sir Syed led by example. During the Bismillah ceremony of his grandson Ross Masood, Sir Syed placed him in the lap of his friend Raja Jai Kishan Das. When Sir Syed established a madarsa in Ghazipur, he elected Raja Dev Narayan Singh as patron of the school. Sanskrit was one of the five languages taught at this school. The managing committee of MAO College comprised 22 members of whom nine were Hindus.  \n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nMan who knew tomorrow\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \nMan who knew tomorrow\n Sir Syed laid the foundation of comparative religious studies and revived the spirit of Dara Shikoh\u2019s philosophy \u2014 to bring major communities of India together by finding commonalities in their religions and assimilate them as a one mighty stream. This is why AMU established the Dara Shikoh Centre for Interfaith Understanding. Section 5 (2)(b) of the AMU Act empowers the university to promote the study of religions, civilisation and culture of India. Also read | \u2018Sir Syed Ahmad Khan tried to eliminate the sectarian attitude that fostered a conservative point of view\u2019 In AMU\u2019s 100 years, it has not only contributed to nation-building but also played a role in India\u2019s quest for building friendly ties with the Muslim world. For this, AMU is recognised as an institution of national importance under the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution. During the course of history, AMU has passed through many challenges but never has it abandoned its inclusive character. Apart from drawing students from 26 other countries, it has students from 31 States and Union Territories and thus represents India\u2019s multi-religious, multi-racial and multi-lingual character. This is why Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during the centenary celebrations of AMU in 2020, called the institution a \u201cmini-India\u201d. Mr. Modi underscored the principles of \u2018nation first\u2019 and \u2018Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas\u2019, while emphasising that Sir Syed established AMU with a rational, progressive and scientific mindset. It is appreciable that the Prime Minister invoked the contribution of a 19th century reformer in the making of 21st century India. This is a testament to the vision of a man who was far ahead of his times.

The former President left the University of California Irvine Medical Centre around 8 a.m. with Hillary Clinton on his arm. Dressed in jeans and a sports coat and wearing a face mask, he made his way out of the hospital slowly and stopped to shake hands with doctors and nurses lined up on the sidewalk. He gave a thumbs-up when a reporter asked how he was feeling, and he and Hillary Clinton then boarded a black SUV. They departed in a motorcade escorted by the California Highway Patrol and headed to the airport. Mr. Bill Clinton\u2019s \u201cfever and white blood cell count are normalized, and he will return home to New York to finish his course of antibiotics,\u201d Dr. Alpesh N. Amin said in a statement shared on Twitter by a Clinton spokesman. Mr. Bill Clinton, 75, was admitted on Tuesday to the hospital southeast of Los Angeles with an infection unrelated to COVID-19. He arrived on Sunday evening at his home in Chappaqua, New York, to continue his recovery. Spokesman Angel Ure\u00f1a had said Saturday that Clinton would remain hospitalised until at least Sunday to receive further intravenous antibiotics. But all health indicators were \u201ctrending in the right direction\u201d, Ms. Ure\u00f1a said. Ms. Hillary Clinton had been with her husband at the hospital and was accompanied there on Saturday by daughter Chelsea. President Joe Biden said on Friday night that he had spoken to Mr. Bill Clinton, and the former President \u201csends his best\u201d. \u201cHe\u2019s doing fine; he really is,\u201d Mr. Biden said during remarks at the University of Connecticut. An aide to the former President said Mr. Bill Clinton had a urological infection that spread to his bloodstream but was on the mend and never went into septic shock, a potentially life-threatening condition. The aide, who spoke to reporters at the hospital on the condition his name wasn\u2019t used, said Mr. Bill Clinton was in an intensive care section of the hospital but wasn\u2019t receiving ICU care. In the years since Mr. Bill Clinton left the White House in 2001, the former President has faced health scares. In 2004, he underwent quadruple bypass surgery after experiencing prolonged chest pains and shortness of breath. He returned to the hospital for surgery for a partially collapsed lung in 2005, and in 2010 he had a pair of stents implanted in a coronary artery. He responded by embracing a largely vegan diet that saw him lose weight and report improved health. Mr. Bill Clinton repeatedly returned to the stump, campaigning for Democratic candidates, most notably Ms. Hillary Clinton during her failed 2008 bid for the presidential nomination. And in 2016, as Ms. Hillary Clinton sought the White House as the Democratic nominee, her husband \u2014 by then a grandfather and nearing 70 \u2014 returned to the campaign trail.

The study assessed the performance of the children and their understanding of commands from their mothers, and found that children who had been exposed to several hours of television or mobile phone screens exhibited an inability to comprehend what they were being told. Samya Varadarajan, the lead author of Prevalence of excessive screen time and its association with developmental delay in children aged <5 years: A population-based cross-sectional study in India, which was published recently in the journal PLOS One, said the study tried to understand the association between excessive screen time and developmental delay in children below five years of age. The study was done in 2019, but Dr. Varadarajan, an assistant professor of community medicine at Sri Ramachandra University, said it could be extrapolated to the current scenario, where children are forced to rely on online classes during the pandemic. As much as 70% of the 718 children aged six months to five years, who were studied, had been exposed to excessive screen time, the study found. Most children had been introduced to screens as early as when they were six months of age, and a majority of the children had been exposed to television screens before they turned a year old. Excessive screen time (ST) results in a delay in development of expressive and receptive language. Children learn to express themselves by imitating their parents or caregivers. By the age of three, they start speaking a lot of words. But those exposed to too much ST are unable to do so. \u201cWe have taken eight parameters to understand the development of the child. We say there is a developmental delay when the child is unable to understand what the mother is saying. When the mother says \u2018Come here and sit down\u2019, she is issuing two commands. But the child manages to understand just one command. That is a developmental delay,\u201d Dr. Varadarajan explained. The study found that children exposed to ST tried to imitate the slang they picked up from watching television. They used inappropriate words and were unable to understand simple commands. Though the study was done before the COVID-19 pandemic, she said the results would only be starker now. Schools could have online classes, but for children below the age of five, it should be more activity-based instead of having them watch the screen, she said.

Until a few years ago, my village used to be covered with a blanket of snow in January\u201d. In the larger narrative about the Himalayas that people hold on to, glacial melting attracts public imagination. What\u2019s equally important but fails to garner enough national attention is the haphazard anthropogenic interventions these young fold mountains are being forced to undergo. This column highlights the case of a lesser-known Himalayan region, the area around the hill station of Mukteshwar, and its plight in the face of rapid urbanisation aided by uncontrolled tourism. What does one instantly remember of a hill resort in the Uttarakhand Himalayas? Or what is it that pushes people out of Delhi to hill stations like Shimla, Nainital and Mussoorie? Snow, touching the clouds, rivers, streams, forests, clean air, etc. In a nutshell, it is the beauty of being in \u2018nature\u2019 that attracts most people to these places. Mukteshwar is also one such place, fortunate enough to command a wider view of snow-clad peaks, harbouring large areas under oak and deodar forests, apple and peach orchards. But what one sees is just the tip of a fast-disappearing iceberg. The economy of the landscape is booming: with an increasing numbers of tourists, people from the plains buy vacation homes, creating a larger land market which was once not known to this agrarian and horticultural landscape. This sort of uncontrolled urbanisation is coming at a huge ecological cost. Mukteshwar is known to suffer water shortages during the dry seasons. And currently, it is going through one of the worst water crises. The region had a deficit monsoon in 2020 and has had no winter precipitation yet. The demand for water is outrunning its supply. With the changing land-use pattern, especially with increased construction of roads and buildings particularly across areas with water springs, the stress on already existing perennial water sources has risen. One individual from every household spends a whole day fetching water from the leftover springs. As the schools are still shut, kids are spending extra time helping their families tide over the crisis. The growing water tanker business of collecting water from these perennial sources downstream to supply those upstream should not come as a surprise as there are no regulatory measures in place which prescribe rain-water harvesting as mandatory for new constructions. Banj (Oak) forests which are essential for the maintenance of healthy springs are either being cut down for developmental purposes or being invaded by exotic species like Chir (Pine) which is further abetting forest fires and human-wildlife conflict. Added to this is the changing climate which has disrupted the seasonal cycle of weather. This takes the form of a drier atmosphere and lesser winter precipitation, not allowing the water springs to recharge. It is these springs which add up to become small rivulets and feed major rivers which flow through the Terai and the Northern Plains. \u00a0\n We need to realise that the hills have far less carrying capacity than the plains and thus, this pace of urbanisation is unsustainable. The most important lesson of the coronavirus pandemic is that places like Mukteshwar warrant more biodiversity protection.    We need to realise that the hills have far less carrying capacity than the plains and thus, this pace of urbanisation is unsustainable. The most important lesson of the coronavirus pandemic is that places like Mukteshwar warrant more biodiversity protection.  What\u2019s also not generally acknowledged but is a grave concern for a booming hill economy like Mukteshwar is a garbage crisis. It is an ignored fact that the more a populace embraces mass consumerism, the more waste it produces. But the waste production and disposal in the region is unregulated. There isn\u2019t a single solid waste treatment plant in the entire region. One need only peek at a turn in the road to realise that most forested valleys alongside the road are dumped with plastic. Within the villages, it mostly gets burned in the fields and chulhas (fireplaces in the kitchen) putting everyone at risk of inhaling cancerous dioxins. This pandemic has revealed that places like Mukteshwar are always much safer than a city. Though the tourism industry was severely hit, the region reported very few infections. This means that land-hunting will only rise post-pandemic, urbanising the landscape and intensifying unsustainable development projects. Its proximity to the plains (making it reachable in a few hours) will become an additive factor to this project. In this context, the lockdown was a blessing for this regions\u2019s ecology and \u2018Unlock\u2019 has been proving a disaster with no lessons learnt. It is necessary to realise that the hills have far less carrying capacity than the plains and thus, this pace of urbanisation is unsustainable. The most important lesson of the coronavirus pandemic is that places like Mukteshwar warrant greater biodiversity protection. The practice of impinging upon and conquering homes of other beings has put us in the midst of the pandemic in the first place. This region harbours rich bird and butterfly diversity. The leopard population is rising but the habitat that can nurture it is constantly shrinking. All of this demands better conservation measures. After going through the above description of the issue pertaining to this place, one would instantly jump to the question \u201cWhat to do?\u201d Instead, one should ask \u201cwhat not to do?\u201d. It is the former that has given us impatient solutions which in effect turned out to complicate the existing problems or suggest surface-level interventions without curing the deeper malaise. For the crises analysed above, what we need is a cognitive and spiritual shift in looking at nature, that is, trying to be in unity with it and respecting the interdependence that thrives in it. If we as a culture start in that direction, then the problems that we have created through solutionism will automatically wane with time and much suffering can be avoided.

After celebrating their daughter\u2019s engagement, the Mavunkal family got ready to retire for the evening at their house in Vallayil in Cherthala municipality of Alappuzha district. Suddenly, the police rushed in \u2014 some plain-clothed and others uniformed. They went over to the patriarch of the family, 52-year-old Monson Mavunkal, and handcuffed him. Bouncers in Monson\u2019s house, dressed in body-hugging tights, jumped in to save their master. They flexed their biceps and puffed out their chests but retreated meekly when the men and women flashed their IDs. Some took to their heels, eyewitnesses say. \u201cI was about to shut my shop when I heard the commotion. I saw a few young men running. I stopped some of them \u2014 they had had lemonade at my shop earlier \u2014 and asked them what was happening. But they were too flustered to reply,\u201d says Prashanth whose shop is about 50 metres from the Mavunkal household. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 Monson\u2019s arrest didn\u2019t make it to the next day\u2019s newspapers as the Crime Branch (CB) managed to keep it well under wraps. But a day later, headlines flashed everywhere in Kerala about the man who had allegedly swindled tens of people of hundreds of crores; a fabulist who had wilfully blurred the line between fact and fiction for personal gain. \u201cMonson had moved in more than a decade ago and came across as a perfect gentleman. He would sponsor both the local church and temple festivals. He created the impression that he was a hotshot antiquities dealer. So, you can imagine how his arrest came as a shock,\u201d says John Varghese, Monson\u2019s immediate neighbour in Cherthala. The drama then shifted some 45 km from Cherthala to Kaloor in the heart of Kochi city as CB sleuths raided Monson\u2019s rented house, the size of a mansion. This house had doubled up as his private museum and stored what he had claimed were rare antiquities. Also read | Tale of deception triggers political face-off Monson boasted that his collections included the Staff of Moses, silver pieces received by Judas Iscariot for betraying Jesus Christ to Roman soldiers, the throne of Tipu Sultan, a copy of the first edition of the Holy Bible, books and parchments from the libraries of Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb and Maratha king Chhatrapati Shivaji, the original and hitherto unknown works of Raja Ravi Varma and Pablo Picasso, and crores worth of chemicals that were used for a rocket launch and were certified, he claimed, by a scientist from the Defence Research and Development Organisation. Monson managed to pass off the majority of these cheap knockoffs as rare antiquities. He even got them showcased by media houses. He successfully made people believe that he was an antiquities dealer \u2014 by the time he was arrested, after six of his victims jointly petitioned the Chief Minister, he had allegedly cheated people of crores of rupees. The six petitioners said he had cheated them of \u20b910 crore. Also read | Petitioners against Monson allege threat to life Monson told everyone that his bank account had been credited with \u20b92.62 lakh crore from selling antiquities abroad, and had been frozen under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) since July 2010. He showed bank statements, Finance Ministry papers and even Reserve Bank of India documents \u2014 all forged \u2014 to his victims to convince them to fund his (non-existent) legal fight to get his funds released. While his collection of \u2018antiquities\u2019 and nearly two dozen premium cars showcased his wealth, his connections with the police, politicians, civil servants, film stars, and business fraternity were shown by countless photos and videos. These further convinced his victims of Monson\u2019s influence.  \n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nFraudster\u2019s arrest puts top Kerala leaders, officers in a spot\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \nFraudster\u2019s arrest puts top Kerala leaders, officers in a spot\n \u201cWhenever we asked for our money, he organised a mediation by these influential people and kept fleecing us,\u201d says Anoop V. Ahammad, one of the petitioners who allegedly gave Monson nearly \u20b96 crore in less than four years. Monson allegedly once organised a meeting in which a senior Congress MP from Kerala agreed to mediate on his behalf through the Public Accounts Committee, constituted by Parliament, to expedite the release of his funds. One of Monson\u2019s immediate neighbours, who wished to remain anonymous, in Kaloor recollects how the narrow lane along his house was often choked with the vehicles of visiting celebrities. Monson even took some of the petitioners to Delhi, where he reportedly got them to exit through the green channel at the airport and arranged a three-star vehicle, purportedly allotted to senior police officials, to shift them to a premium hotel to further prove his influence. He gave away premium vehicles and rare \u2018antiquities\u2019 to placate the petitioners at various points.  \n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nCopper plate manuscript on Sabarimala recovered from Monson fake: Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan \n\n\n\n\u00a0 \nCopper plate manuscript on Sabarimala recovered from Monson fake: Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan  Then, some eight months ago, the petitioners ran out of patience as Monson\u2019s claims turned even more outrageous \u2014 he even invoked the Prime Minister to sell his story. \u201cThat was when we turned really suspicious and started gathering evidence against him and cross-verifying his claims. We wanted to bind him to something legally tenable. We insisted on an agreement to get our money back,\u201d says Anoop. As the demand for a refund got shriller, Monson even sent two of the petitioners to West Asia to generate funds through the sale of antiquities, convincing them that he could not accompany them as there was a travel ban in place. When they demanded ownership documents of the antiquities, he instead gave them police documents calling for high security for his \u2018rare collections\u2019.  \n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nMotor Vehicles Department awaiting documents on Monson\u2019s \u2018luxury\u2019 cars\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \nMotor Vehicles Department awaiting documents on Monson\u2019s \u2018luxury\u2019 cars\n As persuasion no longer worked, Monson apparently turned to coercion. He flashed the three guns he had and even invoked his connection with the gangster Dawood Ibrahim. He weaved a story of how he killed a person and hung the body from a metro pillar in Mumbai using his connections. He even showed injury marks on his body as proof of his rough life. Nevertheless, the petitioners got him to agree to return the money within three months earlier this year. At the same time, they started digging into his past. Monson was one of four children of a family from a humble background in Cherthala. \u201cThough he carried his father\u2019s family name, he wasn\u2019t in contact with the Mavunkal family. He grew up at his mother\u2019s place in Chaaramangalam in Cherthala. He moved to Idukki after getting married. Then he moved to Vallayil and built a home on the land he got as his share from his father more than a decade earlier. To be honest, we had suspected something fishy as he turned up escorted by premium cars and bodyguards,\u201d says Jose Mavunkal, a relative. Monson\u2019s life in Rajakumari, Idukki, where his wife got a job as a schoolteacher, remains largely unknown. He reportedly used to deal with used cars and electronic equipment.  \n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nA plot that rivals the best of con movies \n\n\n\n\u00a0 \nA plot that rivals the best of con movies    \u201cHe was a very decent bloke who did pretty much everything. He was mostly in Ernakulam even then before he left the place permanently after his wife opted for voluntary retirement,\u201d says Joshy, a wiring worker who was very close to Monson during his days in Rajakumari. But Aji Nettoor, his driver for over 10 years, does not speak of Monson glowingly. Instead, he has some damning things to share about his former employer. \u201cI left him eight months ago after I found that he had transacted over \u20b92 crore through my account without my knowledge. He had opened bank accounts in the names of his employees using his address and had also handled the passbook, chequebook, and ATM. I confronted him when he asked me to lie about a transaction made through my account and left him soon after that,\u201d he says. It emerged then that Monson had a case registered against him at Panthalam police station in Pathanamthitta in 2020 for cheating a man called Rajendran Pillai of Sreevalsam Group of \u20b96.27 crore using the same FEMA plot. \u201cWe were promised an interest-free loan of up to \u20b9100 crore to tide over our financial crisis once his frozen funds were released. But then we realised that he was a fraud and registered the case,\u201d says Shahul Hameed, manager of Sreevalsam Group. \n\n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nMonson\u2019s \u2018police and political connections\u2019 rock Assembly\n\n\n\n\n \nMonson\u2019s \u2018police and political connections\u2019 rock Assembly\n As a counter, Monson registered a case alleging that the group didn\u2019t pay the remaining lease running into crores for using his 20-odd premier vehicles kept at the group\u2019s yard. Despite the alleged high-level police intervention to stop it, the Alappuzha District Crime Branch took over the case and found it to be without basis. Now 19 of those vehicles, which Monson had claimed included the one used by Bollywood actor Kareena Kapoor, remain in the custody of Cherthala police. In another case, Rajeev Sreedharan, a resident of Pala in Kottayam district, allegedly lost \u20b91.72 crore after falling for Monson\u2019s offer to get 500 acres of an estate at Sulthan Bathery in Wayanad which was on lease to the Madhya Pradesh government. Monson is also accused of blackmailing a sexual abuse victim with the footage of the abuse to withdraw the case in which his friend was the perpetrator. Ernakulam South Police registered a case in this regard earlier this year and has sent his mobile phone for forensic examination. Also read | Congress MP Behanan alleges global racket behind \u2018antique cheating\u2019 The Monson saga keeps throwing up names along the way. These include Anitha Pullayil, a Malayali expatriate with Italian citizenship, whose association with the accused and the high echelons of the State Police made headlines. Pullayil has since then gone on record saying she came to know Monson through the Loka Malayali Sabha, which consists of Malayali expatriates. She admitted to having recommended, as an acquaintance, Monson\u2019s private museum to a former State Police chief but claimed to have distanced herself from him after being warned of his fraudulent ways. She even warned the petitioners about Monson. Monson used his multiple self-styled profiles to his advantage. Besides claiming to be a German-trained cosmetologist and having an honorary doctorate, he claimed to be the managing director of Kalinga Kalyan Foundation, patron of the Pravasi Malayali Federation and allegedly impersonated the chairman of TV Samskara channel, a charge which is now being investigated by CB. Monson\u2019s arrest and the pictures and videos that bombarded social media from then also triggered a political storm. Detractors of Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee president K. Sudhakaran found it a perfect weapon to attack him as he was mentioned in the petition. Sudhakaran\u2019s photograph at the alleged trickster\u2019s house went viral. Sudhakaran denied any association with Monson, but this did not cut any ice with them. \n\n\n\n\n\nMonson Mavunkal (blue shirt), now in custody. Photo: Special Arrangement\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 The ruling Left Democratic Front was cornered as well, after top police officers, including then State Police chief Loknath Behera, were found pictured with Monson\u2019s fake antiquities. This even forced Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, who also holds the Home Ministry portfolio, to warn the police that they should be careful about their contacts. Behera, now the managing director of Kochi Metro Rail Limited, found himself in a tight spot and he even had to explain that his current leave of absence was not due to the Monson episode, but was for something unrelated. Monson\u2019s alleged trickery also touched a raw nerve with Malayali society when it emerged that a copper inscription from his collection was used to prove a point in favour of the entry of women into Sabarimala, the hilltop Ayyappa temple, during the violent protests of 2018. A reporter with a television news channel, who is now in the dock for his alleged close connections with Monson, first broke the story, which was later followed up by the CPI(M)\u2019s mouthpiece.  \n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep off dubious persons, CM tells cops\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \nKeep off dubious persons, CM tells cops\n The inscription, claimed to be over three centuries old, reportedly stated that the hill shrine had followed a Dravidian ritualistic tradition in the olden days, thus justifying women\u2019s entry. The Pandalam royal family, trustees of the Sabarimala Ayyappa Temple, has sought an investigation into the authenticity of the inscription. Suresh Kumar, a Thiruvananthapuram-based sculptor, is another of Monson\u2019s alleged victims. He is steeped in debts after he sold nine sculptures worth \u20b980 lakh to Monson in 2019 but received only \u20b97 lakh. \u201cI had been visiting him at least once every week to get my money. Now, I am left with a debt of \u20b930 lakh and live in a single room. I had an open-heart surgery and the meagre pension of \u20b91,600 is not even enough to buy medicines,\u201d says the sculptor with 45 years of experience. Investigators have recovered four of the sculptures, which Kumar says were badly redone, probably to pass off as antiquities. About 70% of Monson\u2019s fake antiquities were bought from a man called Santhosh in Ernakulam who used to rent them for film shoots. Most of his premium vehicles were bought from a Bengaluru-based dealer to whom Monson allegedly still owes a large sum. \u201cOnly three of the eight premium cars in his house in Kaloor were road-worthy. Most of them were registered outside the State and we don\u2019t have the details in our database. Even the details of the three cars in our database will have to be verified,\u201d says Ernakulam Regional Transport Officer P.M. Shabeer. Also read | SIT probing Monson case expanded Customs also initially showed some interest in the vehicles but lost interest as none of them were imported in Monson\u2019s name. \u201cIn the case of antiquities, the owner is bound to explain their procurement. But in this case, even that didn\u2019t apply as the majority of them were fake,\u201d says a senior Customs official. Monson also claimed to possess ivory and a number of valuable conches, forcing forest officers to wade in. \u201cThe ivory pair and conches prima facie appear to be fake. But we will send them to the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology for scientific assessment nevertheless,\u201d says Geo Basil Paul, Range Officer, Kodanad. Since his arrest, CB has registered five cases against Monson \u2014 four for cheating and one for impersonation. What seems to trouble the investigation team is the fact that he had reportedly collected only part of the money that he had allegedly swindled through bank accounts, and that too belonging to his employees; most of the funds were received by hand. For a man accused of cheating people of crores, his bank account was found to have a balance of merely \u20b9200. He reportedly spent about \u20b925 lakh a month to maintain his lavish lifestyle, including an array of bouncers. \u201cIt will be hard to make the cheating charges stick since there is little money trail through his account. It is too early to say whether he had stacked the money elsewhere,\u201d say senior CB sources. Also read | Monson fabricated antiquities for govt, says Surendran With Monson\u2019s alleged frauds growing, State Police Chief Anil Kant has formed a special investigation squad headed by Sparjan Kumar, Inspector General, Thiruvananthapuram Range, to probe the cases against him. Meanwhile, the Kerala High Court has lambasted the State police. It even went to the extent of wondering whether the CB investigation will be effective considering the allegations against officers of various ranks. Justice Devan Ramachandran asked the State Police Chief why the police gave Monson protection instead of taking action against him when he claimed to be in possession of valuable articles. Monson, it seems, was arrested in the nick of time, for the petitioners who conducted a parallel probe against him allege that he was in the midst of some new fraudulent activity. He apparently claimed to have sold 93 articles to the Qatari royal family for \u20b915,000 crore for display in a museum there. Going by his strike rate in conning people, Monson would have probably pulled off even that with ease. ", "title": "How the law caught up with an artful dodger in Kerala - The Hindu", "author": "M.P.

setback when the number of violent incidents in the Kashmir Valley was the lowest in five years. Orchestrated allegedly by a shadowy force calling itself The Resistance Front (TRF), termed by security forces as being set up by the LeT, the killings have resulted in fear gripping the Valley\u2019s minority Hindu and Sikh communities. Notwithstanding statements from mainstream political parties and separatist organisations condemning the violence, many Kashmiri Pandit and Sikh employees abstained from work or took leave temporarily, worried about their security. This is an unfortunate outcome that calls to mind the exodus of Kashmiri Pandits due to terror attacks in the early 1990s. The reversal of this dangerous trend requires not only a reassurance of security from the Government for members of the minority communities such as the Pandits and the Sikhs but also a commitment for solidarity with the victims from the various political forces and civil society. The targeted nature of the killings by a \u201cfaceless\u201d terror group suggests that its aim was to use the disquiet in the Valley with the recent administrative and political measures to foment communal discord and violence. Beyond the condemnation from the polity, civil society in such situations must take the initiative to foster communal amity and to mobilise people across communities against hatred. In this regard, the recent appeals by some masjids in Srinagar requesting the public to show solidarity with the victims and to prevent the furthering of fear among Kashmiri Pandits is a welcome step indicating an intention to not let the situation deteriorate to what happened in the early 1990s. The UT administration followed up with a strong crackdown on the insurgency seeking to isolate and quell the militant network that is allegedly responsible for the attacks. While the reactions from the polity and civil society and the administrative actions by the Government are necessary, they are not sufficient to restore normalcy in the Valley. The suspension of the polity with the absence of an elected Assembly, and the stasis and alienation that had set in since the abrogation of J&K\u2019s special status, its bifurcation and designation as a Union Territory would make the job of administration even more difficult. An immediate renewal of political dialogue to address this along with the restoration of Statehood and the complete resumption of political and press freedoms will help create the environment to isolate and tackle terror in the region.

She has worked at Wasabi at The Taj in Mumbai, and knows that importing ingredients like kombu, nori or wakame wouldn\u2019t be a sustainable business model, nor would it bring \u2018Indianness\u2019 to a platter. It\u2019s for chefs like her and for those who want to harness the untapped seaweed business that the government has come up with an investment of some \u20b9640 crore. It hopes to increase seaweed production to 10 crore tonnes by 2025 under the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana.  For now, Niyati\u2019s hunt has ended at AquAgri, a private seaweed processing unit, in Tamil Nadu\u2019s Manamadurai town. From here, she has been able to procure vast quantities of dry seaweed, and is now experimenting with it in her kitchen. Seaweed, she says, adds a note of piquancy to each dish: as garnish in salad or a sprinkling on a hearty soup, the dense oceanic notes bring a rich umami depth to any vegetarian dish. Even something as ordinary as butter, when infused with seaweed, opens up new gastronomical delights, she says. Stabilising factor Indians have only just started flirting with the possibility of using the product in the hospitality industry ; but seaweed has long been sourced by the food industry for its stabilising properties. When processed, it loses its pungency, and seaweed products such as agar gel can withstand high temperatures \u2014 it can be used as a stabiliser and thickener in pie fillings, icings and meringues. As it is tasteless, it does not interfere with the flavour of the food, and in ice creams it is used to inhibit the crystallisation of ice. Agar-agar, the main ingredient in falooda and jigarthanda, is a seaweed-based product.  Earlier, seaweed was collected by fishermen through natural harvesting. It was only in 2000 that the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research\u2013Central Salt and Marine Chemicals Research Institute (CSIR-CSMCRI), along with Pepsico, started cultivating seaweed through the bamboo raft method on an experimental basis. Later, AquAgri joined hands with CSIR-CSMCRI and ICAR-Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (ICAR-CMFRI) and now, the shoreline in places including Mandapam in Tamil Nadu\u2019s Rameswaram are dotted with floating farms of seaweed. Buttressed by studies done by ICAR-CMFRI and CSIR-CSMCRI, fisherwomen in these regions have been trained in cultivating a species of seaweed called Kappaphycus alvarezii that yields carrageenan. Carrageenan is an additive used to thicken, emulsify, and preserve food and drinks \u2014 it\u2019s a commercially viable venture.  Fertiliser of the future Alginate, another extract, is used in restructured and reformed food products such as chicken nuggets. As a binder and  \n\n\n\n\n\nFsherman harvest seaweed in the Thoothukudi coast.\n\u00a0\n| Photo Credit: N. Rajesh \n\n\n\n\n emulsifier, it helps meat retain its shape. The seaweed extract, when injected into meat, helps retain its moistness and freshness. Suguna Foods and Venky\u2019s are other major clients of AquAgri. Although many are wary of using plain dried seaweed in food, cultivation in a controlled environment could result in more people consuming this product packed with vitamins and minerals, say buyers. Seeing the nutrient value of this sea vegetable and encouraged by the Indian Farmers Fertiliser Cooperative, AquAgri manufactures a product called Sagarika, derived from the sap of red and brown algae, which acts as a bioenhancer and stimulates the internal growth of plants. Researchers say that an extract from seaweed also helps in the faster germination of seeds, and this was successfully tested on cotton seeds. As organic farming becomes the buzzword, seaweed is becoming the fertiliser of the future.  Flavour of the sea In medicine, research shows a lot of exciting possibilities. ICAR-CMFRI, Kochi, has used seaweed as the main ingredient in various nutraceutical products, from anti-obesity tablets to anti-arthritic and anti-diabetic pills. At AquAgri, research is on to make a biofilm from seaweed extract, to be used as a dissolvable cast to dress wounds.  Economically, seaweed has empowered women in and around Rameswaram. \n\n\n\n\n\nWomen dive for seaweed in Rameswaram.\n\u00a0\n| Photo Credit: L. Balachandar \n\n\n\n\n It is cultivated nine months in a year, and harvested every 45 days; one kilo of dried seaweed fetches \u20b950 to \u20b955. Jayakumar, principal scientist, ICAR-CMFRI, Mandapam, points out that as the cultivation is less labour-intensive and less-technology driven, it has been taken up by almost 600 women in the region. Industries related to seaweed processing also have a huge potential for those specialising in microbiology, chemistry and food technology. Tapping into this unrealised potential is the \u2018Blue Revolution\u2019 that the government is hoping for, but increasing production is the challenge. B. Johnson, scientist, ICAR-CMFRI, points out, \u201cWhat we produce now is not even enough for the domestic market.\u201d  The reason behind the slow decline in production, say scientists, is that seaweed cultivation has been going on for the past two decades, decreasing the virility of the seeds. Some want seeds to be imported from the Philippines, and for the government to increase the area under cultivation.   And so, it may not be very long before pouches of dried seaweed jostle for space in supermarket aisles along with casks of seaweed wine. In restaurants around the corner, the menu may well have sushi wrapped in Indian-made nori sheets, each bite bringing in the heady flavour of the sea. beulah.r@thehindu.co.in ", "title": "India has a vast potential of seaweed cultivation and marketing - The Hindu", "author": "Beulah Rose", "date": "October 15, 2021 12:58 IST", "preprocessed": "niyati busi fine dine mumbai rush home grown ingredi work wasabi mumbai know import ingredi like kombu nori wakam sustain busi model would bring indian platter chef like want untap seawe busi govern come invest crore hope increas seawe product crore tonn 2025 pradhan mantri matsya sampada yojana niyati hunt aquagri privat seawe process unit tamil nadu manamadurai town procur vast quantiti seawe experi kitchen seawe note piquanc dish garnish salad sprinkl hearti soup dens ocean note bring rich umami depth vegetarian dish even someth ordinari butter infus seawe open gastronom delight stabilis factor indian start flirt possibl product hospit industri seawe long sourc food industri stabilis properti process lose pungenc seawe product agar withstand high temperatur stabilis thicken fill meringu tasteless interfer flavour food cream inhibit crystallis agar agar main ingredi falooda jigarthanda seawe base product earlier seawe collect fisherman natur harvest 2000 council scientif industri research central salt marin chemic research institut csir csmcri along pepsico start cultiv seawe bamboo raft method experiment basi later aquagri join hand csir csmcri icar central marin fisheri research institut icar cmfri shorelin place includ mandapam tamil nadu rameswaram float farm seawe buttress studi done icar cmfri csir csmcri fisherwomen region train cultiv speci seawe call kappaphycu alvarezii yield carrageenan carrageenan addit thicken emulsifi preserv food drink commerci viabl ventur fertilis futur algin anoth extract restructur reform food product chicken nugget binder fsherman harvest seawe thoothukudi coast photo credit rajesh emulsifi help meat retain shape seawe extract inject meat help retain moist fresh suguna food venki major client aquagri although mani wari plain seawe food cultiv control environ could result peopl consum product pack vitamin miner buyer nutrient valu veget encourag indian farmer fertilis cooper aquagri manufactur product call sagarika deriv brown alga bioenhanc stimul intern growth plant research extract seawe also help faster germin seed success test cotton seed organ farm becom buzzword seawe becom fertilis futur flavour medicin research show excit possibl icar cmfri kochi seawe main ingredi variou nutraceut product anti obes tablet anti arthrit anti diabet pill aquagri research make biofilm seawe extract dissolv cast dress wound econom seawe empow woman around rameswaram women dive seawe rameswaram photo credit balachandar cultiv nine month year harvest everi kilo seawe fetch jayakumar princip scientist icar cmfri mandapam point cultiv labour intens technolog driven taken almost woman region industri relat seawe process also huge potenti specialis microbiolog chemistri food technolog unrealis potenti blue revolut govern hope increas product challeng johnson scientist icar cmfri point produc even enough domest market reason behind slow declin product scientist seawe cultiv past decad decreas viril seed want seed import philippin govern increas area cultiv long pouch seawe jostl space supermarket aisl along cask seawe wine restaur around corner menu well sushi wrap indian made nori sheet bite bring headi flavour beulah thehindu"}, {"body": " Cricket Yuvraj Singh was on October 17 arrested by the Haryana Police and let on interim bail as per a High Court order in a case pertaining to offensive remarks against the Scheduled Castes on a social media platform.

A First Information Report was registered against Mr. Singh on February 14 at Hansi\u2019s City Police Station for allegedly making offensive remarks against the Scheduled Castes on a social media platform during a live video chat with fellow cricket players. The case was registered under Section 3 of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, among others, on the complaint of Rajat Kansal, a Dalit rights activist. Mr. Kansal had then told The Hindu that Mr. Singh had made unsavoury comments against the Scheduled Castes talking about fellow cricketer Yuzvendra Chahal in June 2020. He said the video went viral on the social media platforms and crores of people across the world watched it. Mr. Singh had expressed regret for the comments after the controversy and apologised for unintentionally hurting public sentiments. The Punjab and Haryana High Court had directed that in case Mr. Singh was arrested on joining the probe, he should be released on interim bail on furnishing bail and surety bonds.

The greatest asset of The Hindu, founded in September 1878, is trust. Everything we do as a company revolves, and should continue to revolve, round this hard-earned and inestimable long-term asset. The objective of codification of editorial values is to protect and foster the bond of trust between our newspapers and their readers. \n2. The Company must continue to protect the integrity of the newspapers it publishes, their editorial content, and the business operations that sustain and help grow the newspapers. \n3. Our editorial values are rooted in the guiding principles The Hindu set out with and communicated to its readers in \u2018Ourselves,\u2019 the editorial published in its inaugural issue of September 20, 1878. The world has changed but the principles remain vital for us: fairness and justice. The founding editorial also announces the aim of promoting \u2018harmony\u2019 and \u2018union\u2019 (unity) among the people of India and a secular editorial policy of maintaining the \u2018strictest neutrality\u2019 in matters relating to religion while offering fair criticism and comment \u2018when religious questions involve interests of a political and social character.\u2019 \n4. The core editorial values, universally accepted today by all trustworthy newspapers and newspaper-owning companies, are truth-telling, freedom and independence, fairness and justice, good responsible citizenship, humaneness, and commitment to the social good. Practising these values requires, among other things, the Company\u2019s journalists excelling in the professional disciplines, and especially the discipline of verifying everything that is published. It requires our journalists to maintain independence from those they cover, be fair and just in their news coverage, and avoid conflicts of interest. It means being interesting and innovative, and learning and mastering new ways and techniques of storytelling and presentation of editorial content in this digital age so as to engage readers and promote a lively and mutually beneficial conversation with them. Above all, it means the uncompromising practice of editorial integrity. In keeping with the exemplary tradition of a general daily newspaper of record and consistent with contemporary best practice, The Hindu shall, as a rule, maintain a clear distinction between news, critical analysis, and opinion in its editorial content and shall not editorialise or opinionate in news reports. The Company must endeavour to provide in its publications a fair and balanced coverage of competing interests, and to offer the readers diverse, reasonable viewpoints, subject to its editorial judgment. \n5. The Company is fully committed to these values, so that the business and editorial departments and actions, while operating by their own distinctive rules, are on the same page. The two sides must work together closely on the basis of mutual respect and cooperation and in the spirit of living these values in a contemporary sense. \n6. The Company recognises that good journalism cannot survive, develop, and flourish unless it is viable and commercially successful. \n7. Any potential conflict of interest within the Company will be resolved keeping in mind these values. Among other things, this involves raising the standards of transparency and disclosure in accordance with the best contemporary norms and practices in the field. \n8. It is necessary to set and communicate internally and to the public clear standards of journalistic integrity and performance, corporate governance, and business practice. \n9. There is no wall but there is a firm line between the business operations of the Company and editorial operations and content. Pursuant to the above-mentioned values and objectives, it is necessary to create a professionalism in the editorial functioning independent of Shareholder interference so as to maintain an impartiality, fairness, and objectivity in editorial and journalistic functioning.

The average AQI in the capital based on the readings of 31 weather stations stopped two notches short of the \u201cvery poor\u201d category on Sunday at 298. Other parts of the NCR such as Gurugram, Faridabad and Ghaziabad entered the \u201cvery poor\u201d category with AQI readings of 332, 312 and 310, respectively. \u201cFor the past one month, I have been tweeting data of air quality in Delhi. Pollution has increased in the last 3-4 days and it is due to stubble burning in neighbouring States. Farmers in neighbouring States are compelled to burn stubble as their Governments are doing nothing to provide an alternative,\u201d Mr. Kejriwal said.  He added that the Delhi Government was doing its bit to curb vehicular and dust pollution and pollution from stubble burning by spraying bio-decomposer but could not do much to stop the air quality from deteriorating as neighbouring States were yet to act on stubble burning. Environment Minister Gopal Rai said that in the past three days, incidents of stubble burning had increased rapidly in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana which had an adverse impact on Delhi\u2019s air quality that was in the \u201cmoderate\u201d category on Wednesday. \u201cThe Central Government has given about \u20b9250 crore to Punjab for the management of stubble, with which, bio-decomposer can be sprayed free of cost on 50 lakh acres of land but the State Government has not started providing the solution to farmers and no plan has been made to start the use of bio-decomposer outside Delhi,\u201d Mr. Rai said.  He added that the pollution was increasing with the same speed with which incidents of stubble burning had increased in neighbouring States and that the air quality had taken longer to deteriorate this year as the rainy season had lasted longer delaying the harvest season. About the measures within Delhi to curb air pollution, Mr. Rai said \u201cRed Light On, Gaadi Off campaign\u201d would start in the city from October 18 across Delhi to curb vehicular pollution and several long-term measures such as tree transplantation policy and an electric vehicle policy and ensuring factories used PNG had been introduced. \u201cThe Chief Minister has been tweeting the level of pollution in Delhi every day for the last several days. If you look at that chart and the incidents of stubble burning, it will be clear how the stubble leads to a dangerous situation in Delhi\u2019s pollution level,\u201d Mr. Rai said.

This September, the capital city received the highest rainfall in 12 years, with weather stations in the city recording 112.1 mm rainfall in 24 hours. The heavy burst of rain submerged low-lying areas in knee-deep water and affected traffic movement. Many parts of the city went under with just half an hour to one hour of rainfall. What causes this waterlogging and urban flooding?  There are several reasons for this The main reason is the problems related to the city\u2019s stormwater drains. Delhi works on a drainage master plan made in 1976  A new plan was prepared by IIT Delhi for the government in 2018, but it is yet to be implemented. The run-off water from the local rainfall is supposed to drain into the Yamuna through stormwater drains. But due to a combination of reasons, including sewage flowing in stormwater drains, the run-off water does not properly drain into the Yamuna and leads to urban flooding. The drains were made decades ago to handle a particular amount of run-off water. If earlier, a particular amount of rainfall generated 50% of run-off water now, it is about 90%. Over the years, many areas have been developed without a proper street-level drainage system The intensity of rainfall has also increased due to climate change which results in an increase in the amount of water. But the drainage system is the same and it is unable to handle the excess water. Experts say a master plan is needed to study why flooding is happening even with light rain and the govt must come up with a plan to fix it.

Ramesh (DMK), who was booked by the CB-CID police in connection with the murder of a worker in a cashew processing unit owned by him in Panikankuppam, surrendered before the Judicial Magistrate Court I in Panruti near here on Monday. The CB-CID police had already arrested five persons, all employees in the cashew processing unit, on charges of the murder of K. Govindarasu, 60 of Melmampattu on September 20. Mr. Ramesh was named as the prime accused in the case and the CB-CID had launched a search for him. According to police, the victim was working as a labourer in the cashew processing unit for the last seven years. On September 20, Govindarasu was returning home after work when an employee frisked him and accused him of stealing 7 kg of cashew nuts. Govindarasu was allegedly assaulted on the premises and later taken to the Kadampuliyur police station for lodging a complaint. The Station House Officer noticed bleeding injuries on Govindarasu\u2019s face and asked the complainants, Kandavelu and Shanmugam, to take him to the hospital for treatment. However, the duo reportedly took the victim back to the cashew processing unit. Govindarasu was found dead under suspicious circumstances in the unit a few hours later. The CB-CID police is likely to take Mr. Ramesh into custody for interrogation. In a statement issued before his surrender, Mr. Ramesh said that he was pained over political parties indulging in \u201cpolitics of vendetta\u201d over the incident. \u201cI am really pained that such political mileage is being sought by political parties over the CB-CID registering an FIR against me in the murder of a worker in my cashew processing unit,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a sincere functionary of the DMK and having great regard for my leader, I am surrendering before the court. This was only to prevent unnecessary aspersions being cast against the party. I will legally prove with evidence that the complaint against me is baseless and establish my innocence,\u201d he said.

Some in the Democratic camp have suggested that a $1 trillion platinum coin may be issued to bypass the debt ceiling if Republicans refuse to raise it. U.S. Senators reached a compromise on Thursday, which will allow the U.S. Government to meet its spending obligations till December. However, the bipartisan fight over the debt ceiling looks far from over. What is the debt ceiling? The U.S. Congress limits the total amount of debt that the U.S. Government can borrow to finance its spending. The debt ceiling has been gradually raised over the decades, from around $4 trillion in the early 1990s to $28.4 trillion in August, 2021. U.S. Governments generally run a budget deficit, that is, their expenditure exceeds their revenues, which forces them to borrow. The debt ceiling is supposed to serve as a check on government borrowing by forcing the government to live within its means. Quarrels over the U.S. debt ceiling are common as both Republicans and Democrats tend to impede the raising of the ceiling when the other party is in power. This causes trouble for the incumbent government, which is left to scramble for money and possibly even default on existing debt if it fails. Republicans right now are opposing President Joe Biden\u2019s plan to spend $3.5 trillion on various social programmes. They argue that raising the debt ceiling to fund the plan would worsen the situation and lead to higher inflation. What is the $1 trillion platinum coin proposal? The $1 trillion platinum coin is a token coin with a face value of $1 trillion that can be issued by the U.S. Treasury and deposited at the U.S. Federal Reserve, America\u2019s central bank. It will help the U.S. Government to get from the Fed the money that it needs to fund its spending programmes without increasing its overall liabilities. Here\u2019s how it works. Usually, when the U.S. Government wants to borrow money, it issues Treasury bonds to investors. These bonds are then purchased by the Fed in the secondary market, where they are traded actively. The Fed thus indirectly finances the government. But the issuance of these bonds also increases the government\u2019s overall debt figure. This, in turn, could cause a breach of the debt ceiling unless the Treasury simultaneously retires bonds of equal value by paying back investors. With the $1 trillion platinum coin, however, the U.S. Government won\u2019t have to worry about breaching the debt ceiling. Receiving dollars from the Fed in exchange for the coin will not increase the government's liabilities. The platinum coin proposal exploits a loophole in the law that allows the U.S. Treasury to issue platinum coins of any denomination regardless of the actual platinum content of these coins, so much so that some have suggested minting a $1 quadrillion coin. The U.S. Treasury can thus mint a platinum coin of any denomination it wishes and demand an equivalent sum of dollars from the central bank. Gold and silver coins, on the other hand, can be issued only in certain denominations and, more importantly, need to contain a certain weight of gold. This severely limits the amount of dollars the Treasury can demand from the Fed. Nobel laureate Paul Krugman and financial journalist Joe Weisenthal have been at the forefront of the movement in support of the platinum coin proposal. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, however, has ruled out the idea, terming it a \u201cgimmick\u201d. Will it lead to inflation? Inflation has been a major cause of worry in the U.S. since the Fed started pumping trillions of dollars into the economy last year to tackle the economic slump due to the Covid-19 lockdown. Many believe that the $1 trillion platinum coin proposal will further increase the total money supply in the economy and lead to a rise in prices. To be more precise, they argue that the Fed will create fresh dollars in return for the platinum coin deposited by the Treasury and that this will add significantly to the overall money supply. Without a sufficient rise in the overall supply of goods and services in the economy, this can lead to higher prices if people opt to spend rather than hoard the fresh money supplied by the Fed. Supporters of the platinum coin proposal, however, say that the Fed, when it credits the Treasury with $1 trillion worth of fresh dollars, will simultaneously sell U.S. Government bonds worth $1 trillion from its holdings in the open market. This will suck money worth $1 trillion out of the economy and prevent inflation. Other critics, however, point out that bypassing the debt ceiling through such tricks will come at the cost of fiscal discipline. American fiscal conservatives, in particular, have been wary of the influence of modern monetary theory (MMT) in the debt ceiling debate. MMT enthusiasts believe that there is no reason to worry about government debt as it can be easily paid off using fresh dollars created by the Fed. But this will lead to the blurring of the line that separates the government and the central bank and can lead to more reckless spending by short-sighted politicians, critics of MMT believe.

Ltd., had won the bid for the national carrier, Air India. He said that after the setting of a reserve price of \u20b912,906 crore, the Tata Sons subsidiary had emerged the winner, quoting a figure of \u20b918,000 crore. The other shortlisted bidder, Ajay Singh of SpiceJet, had quoted \u20b915,100 crore. Within minutes, Ratan N. Tata, Chairman Emeritus, Tata Sons and Chairman, Tata Trusts, put out a tweet, \u201cWelcome back, Air India!\u201d The Air India group is made up of these components: Air India; Air India Express, Air India Engineering Services Limited (AIESL), Air India Air Transport Services Limited (AIATSL; ground handling services to the Air India group and other airlines), Airline Allied Services Limited, or AASL (Alliance Air); the Hotel Corporation of India (Centaur hotels and the Chefair flight kitchens) and Air India SATS Airport Services Private Limited (AISATS is a 50:50 joint venture between Air India Limited and Singapore Airport Terminal Services Limited (SATS) .  \n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nChronology of Air India privatisation\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \nChronology of Air India privatisation\n The Air India sale this time is the third attempt by the Government of India (incidentally, all under the National Democratic Alliance), the earlier bids having been in the early 2000s and 2017-2018. This time round, the Government offered management control and sale of 100% equity share capital, each, of Air India and Air India Express and a 50% equity share capital of Air India SATS Airport Services Private Limited \u2014 which the Tatas have won. The airline\u2019s total debt at the end of August this year was \u20b961,562 crore. Of this, Tata Sons (its holding company Talace Pvt. Ltd.) would be taking over \u20b915,300 crore, with a cash payment of \u20b92,700 crore. The rest, an estimated \u20b946,262 crore, will be moved to Air India Assets Holding Ltd (AIAHL), a special purpose vehicle formed by the Government to handle the debt and non-core assets of Air India such as land and buildings. Much of the debt is related to the merger between Air India and the other state-owned carrier, Indian Airlines, which was cleared by the Cabinet on March 1, 2007 to form the National Aviation Company of India Limited (NACIL). Preceding this development \u2014 i.e. of the merger \u2014 the then United Progressive Alliance government, had in 2005, approved the purchase of 68 aircraft by Air India (from Boeing) \u2014 and also the largest commercial aircraft deal in India\u2019s civil aviation history \u2014 and a year later, 43 planes for Indian Airlines (from the Airbus 320 family, for $2.2 billion). The Boeing deal was for 23 777s, 27 787s and 18 737s (for low cost carrier Air India Express). Boeing has also built and transferred a state-of-the-art maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) facility at Nagpur. Following mounting losses, there was an investigation into allegations about the nearly \u20b970,000 crore deal that had caused a financial loss to the \u201calready stressed national carrier\u201d. It also inducted A320Ns on lease from the ALAFCO Aviation Lease and Finance Company in 2017.  \n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nWork to monetise Alliance Air, 3 other Air India subsidiaries to start now: DIPAM Secy\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \nWork to monetise Alliance Air, 3 other Air India subsidiaries to start now: DIPAM Secy\n As far as debt clearance is concerned, the Government is to also transfer to the AIAHL about \u20b916,000 crore of unpaid fuel bills and other pending dues that Air India owes to airports and vendors. In short, it will hold about 75% of the airline\u2019s debt that the Tata Group is not taking over. An aviation consultant said the Tatas could also take over an additional and estimated \u20b99,000 crore worth of lease obligations for over 40 Air India jets. The non-core assets including land and buildings that are estimated to be valued at \u20b914,718 crore are being transferred to the AIAHL. There are reports that the Government is planning to add the feeder/regional airline, Alliance Air (the second wholly owned Air India subsidiary) to this mix, with an eye to selling it. If this happens, the Government will completely exit the airline business. According to Mr. Pandey, the airline loses \u20b920 crore a day. And, from 2009-10 to date, the Government has infused over \u20b91,10,276 crore into the airline; \u20b954,584 crore as cash support and \u20b955,692 crore as loan guarantees. The sale deal is expected to be wrapped up by December-end (though some experts say it could go on till March). The four Air India subsidiaries, AIATSL, AASL, AIESL, the Hotel Corporation of India Ltd., and non-core assets, that also include the fabled collection of art work, paintings and artefacts, and other non-operational assets have been transferred to the IAHL. Air India, the Ministry of Civil Aviation and Tata Sons did not respond to queries from The Hindu on the subject. However, aviation experts have tried to piece things together. The contours cover human resources, fleet management, flight scheduling and technology services. The Tatas already have two airlines in the stable, which are still in poor financial health: Vistara (a joint venture with Singapore Airlines Limited as a 51:49% stake partnership) and Air Asia India, a low-cost service, where the Tatas now have a nearly 84% stake. An aviation analyst said that going by data from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), the Tatas could now have a 26% share of the domestic aviation market that would put them behind market leader IndiGo with its estimated 57% market share. Opinion is that there could be mergers and synergy between the four airlines.  \n\n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nAir India Express in focus as Tatas buy Air India\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \nAir India Express in focus as Tatas buy Air India\n The Air India deal catapults the conglomerate into the big league, making it the largest player from India on international routes. First, the positives. The brand, Air India, has an instant connect. According to a Tata datasheet, there will be a fleet strength of 141 aircraft (117 from Air India and 24 from Air India Express), and a widespread domestic and international footprint (over 7,000 slots and also code share agreements) with a significant share of the revenue from international operations. Its non-stop long haul flights from India to the United States are a high point. There is also a repository of bilateral rights, which experts say could be used to expand flights in a big way to Europe, Africa and South America, for example. The Air India frequent flyer programme has nearly three million members. The airline has experienced crew, ground staff and engineers. It is also a member of the 26-member global aviation grouping, Star Alliance. In terms of the crucial aviation operating metrics, among Indian carriers, it has a high Available Seat Passenger Kilometre (ASKM) and Revenue Passenger Kilometre (RPKM). It has also cleared recognised safety audits and won international awards for its environmental performance. The airline also has a few firsts and records to its name.  \n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018AI-Vistara may hit global plans of IndiGo, SpiceJet\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \n\u2018AI-Vistara may hit global plans of IndiGo, SpiceJet\u2019\n According to an aviation expert, the negatives would be linked to the structure of its finance lease/bridge loans and operating leases for a part of its fleet, the poor state of the cabins, seats and inflight amenities on most of its aircraft fleet, staff strength in certain administrative functions, the cost contracts for some of its subsidiaries, and the training at and safety record of Air India Express. Part of the fleet has also been grounded for a long time for want of crucial spares and engine parts. Not having Alliance Air as a part of the group could be a setback as it \u201coperates flights to Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities or those which link these cities to the metro hubs\u201d. Thus, what would have been inhouse and seamless regional passenger feed to the main flights (international and domestic) could now be hampered. The total number of permanent and contractual employees of Air India and Air India Express is 13,500. According to Mr. Pandey, there cannot be retrenchment of staff for the first year. Gratuity and provident fund benefits will be according to the law and post-retirement medical benefits (for retired staff and staff to retire) will be provided by the Government. Another aviation expert said a Tata team had visited all the Air India facilities and \u201csought every possible document\u201d. These may have also been to examine details of agreements and contracts with third parties; liabilities and commitments; available licences and approvals and internal and third party audit reports. \n\n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nSale of Air India to Tatas a \u2018gift\u2019, say unions\n\n\n\n\n \nSale of Air India to Tatas a \u2018gift\u2019, say unions\n According to Captain Mohan Ranganathan, a retired airline instructor pilot, aviation safety expert and an industry watcher, \u201cThe Tatas have got just the airline, aircraft, routes and landing slots. The hangars and engineering belong to the AIESL, and will all be sold off separately. If the Tatas want them, they have to bid and pay! The training centres in Mumbai and Hyderabad are also in that category. The Air India employees in the housing colonies have been given six months notice or sale of the land, whichever is earlier. The Tatas will have to spend a huge amount getting the aircraft refurbished and fitted to their standards. \u201cThe biggest problem is the integration of Air Asia India and Air India Express. Their style of operations is completely different. The integration is not easy and will be time consuming. The Government has also sold out to the Gulf carriers with bilaterals in their favour. Whether the Government will rework them now, is the question,\u201d he said.   Former Executive Director, Air India, Jitender Bhargava, in a commentary, has said, \u201cThe question of how rapidly the Tatas can make the airline profitable needs to be viewed in the context of the impact of the pandemic, additional domestic factors such as price sensitivity of Indian passengers and high operational costs. \u201cAir India also has very limited non-aeronautical revenues. Monetising every customer-interfacing object, as most airlines do, will add to revenues. The real gains will emerge once the initial phases of cost reduction and enhancing revenues are over and the Tatas move to the next phase of fleet expansion, which should be a priority,\u201d he said. \u201cThe new owners will be able to operate additional flights without having the need to induct more operating crew or aircraft maintenance engineers because rationalisation of manpower and higher productivity through reengineered work practices will generate surplus manpower to meet future needs.  \n\n\nWatch | How Air India came back to the Tatas\n\n\n \n\n\n\u00a0 \u201cOnce Air India\u2019s current inherent weaknesses largely stemming from Government ownership, inability to exploit full potential due to inertia, adverse impact on the morale of employees due to frequent changes of leadership are made a thing of the past on the Tatas taking control, positive all-round results will be there for all to see. Turning around Air India by making it profitable once again after several years will be a daunting but achievable task. It will also be a long-haul flight for the Tatas and one should make no mistake about it by being over ptimistic because the ground realities of the Indian market cannot be simply wished away,\u201d Mr. Bhargava said.  \n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nAir India privatisation: \u20b916,000 crore unpaid bills to go to government\u2019s AIAHL\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \nAir India privatisation: \u20b916,000 crore unpaid bills to go to government\u2019s AIAHL\n Another aviation industry expert said it is most certain that Tata Sons will tap the capabilities of its group companies such as Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) to formulate the digital and technological transformation of Air India. This would be to run the airline\u2019s technology services end-to-end, enabling automation to analytics-enabled decision-making. The end result is to have \u201cintelligent airline operations\u201d. TCS is no stranger to the aviation and airline business and has clients such as Singapore Airlines and Virgin Atlantic. An aviation expert said that while the new owner may have several and efficient business strategies, it would benefit from the legacy of experience of today\u2019s Air Indians.

step toward jump starting the country\u2019s space programme and achieving ambitious goals in 6G networks, spy satellites, and even lunar probes. (Sign up to our Technology newsletter, Today's Cache, for insights on emerging themes at the intersection of technology, business and policy. Click here to subscribe for free.) If all goes well, the three-stage NURI rocket, designed by the Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI) to eventually put 1.5-ton payloads into orbit 600 to 800 km above the Earth, will carry a dummy satellite into space on Thursday. South Korea\u2019s last such booster, launched in 2013 after multiple delays and several failed tests, was jointly developed with Russia. The new KSLV-II NURI has solely Korean rocket technologies,and is the country's first domestically built space launch vehicle, said Han Sang-yeop, director of KARI's Launcher Reliability Safety Quality Assurance Division. \"Having its own launch vehicle gives a country the flexibility of payload types and launch schedule,\" he told Reuters in an email. It also gives the country more control over \u201cconfidential payloads\u201d it may want to send into orbit, Han said. That will be important for South Korea\u2019s plans to launch surveillance satellites into orbit, in what national security officials have called a constellation of \u201cunblinking eyes\u201d to monitor North Korea. So far, South Korea has remained almost totally reliant on the United States for satellite intelligence on its northern neighbour. In 2020 a Falcon 9 rocket from the U.S. firm Space X carried South Korea\u2019s first dedicated military communications satellite into orbit from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. NURI is also key to South Korean plans to eventually build a Korean satellite-based navigation system and a 6G communicationsnetwork. \u201cThe program is designed not only to support government projects, but also commercial activity,\u201d Oh Seung-hyub, director of the Launcher Propulsion System Development Division, told a briefing on Tuesday. South Korea is working with the United States on a lunar orbiter, and hopes to land a probe on the moon by 2030. Given problems with previous launches, Han and other planners said they have prepared for the worst. The launch day may be changed at the last minute if weather or technical problems arise; the craft will carry a self-destruct mechanism to destroy it if it appears it won't reach orbit; and media won\u2019t be allowed to observe the test directly. At least four test launches are planned before the rocket will be considered reliable enough to carry a real payload. According to pre-launch briefing slides, the rocket\u2019s planned path will take it southeast from its launch site on the south coast of the Korean peninsula, threading its way over the ocean on a trajectory aimed at avoiding flying over Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines, and other major land masses. \"This upcoming launch may be remembered as the hope and achievement of Korean rocketry historically no matter the launch is successful or not,\" Han told Reuters. Space rockets on the Korean peninsula have been fraught with concerns over their potential use for military purposes, leaving South Korea\u2019s efforts lagging more capable programmes in China and Japan. \"Modern rocketry in Korea couldn't devote its capability much in R&D of rockets because of long-standing political issues,\" Han said. The United States has viewed North Korea\u2019s own satellite launch vehicles as test beds for nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile technology. A North Korean space launch in 2012 helped lead to the breakdown of a deal with the United States. \"North Korea, of course, will not look favourably on South Korea\u2019s rapidly advancing space capabilities, which are far more technologically advanced than those possessed by the North,\"said James Clay Moltz, a space systems expert at the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School. South Korea\u2019s push into space comes as it speeds ahead with its own military ballistic missile systems after agreeing with the United States this year to end all bilateral restrictions onthem. \"There is no concern on military applications in NURI launch vehicle development,\" said Chang Young-keun, a missile expert at the Korea Aerospace University. Unlike the liquid-fuelled NURI,South Korea\u2019s military missiles use solid fuel, which is better for weapons, he added. South Korea is not seen as a \"threat\" by either Russia or China, so it seems unlikely to affect their space programs, which are already highly militarised, Moltz said. \"Many space launch technologies are inherently dual-use,\" he said, but noted that he hopes NURI\u2019s development will \"not lead to an arms race in space, but instead a safer \u2018information race\u2019\" where South Korea has better intelligence to head off any future crisis.

Ever since Squid Game\u2019s premiere on September 17, the nine-episode Korean series directed by Hwang Dong-hyuk has been the most watched and talked about show across the globe \u2014 it amassed 111 billion views since its release making it Netflix\u2019s biggest series ever. Real-life ironyPeony Hirwani, Jaipur-based culture writer at The Independent, explains how such shows help people process trauma and think through what\u2019s going on in the world. \u201cSquid Game belongs to the battle royale realm, like Hunger Games, The Running Man and Liar Game. However, the deadly game trope, the storyline, class differences, and deaths, make it a compelling watch. They\u2019ve literally viewed humans as mere toys in this series \u2014 something that humans usually do with other living beings on this planet for their own benefit. It\u2019s almost ironic.\u201d \u201cThe aesthetic is brilliant and unlike anything on TV right now,\u201d says film critic Raja Sen, explaining that while Squid Game draws us in with drama on a very universal level and makes us care about the characters, it then entices viewers the way a reality show would: with rule-changes, advancing levels, and elimination threats. \u201cAudiences living through a pandemic might be relating more easily to characters whose survival is threatened. We have all lost friends and family over the last year, and that, clubbed with anxiety and uncertainty on various levels, does make us feel trapped like the characters in the show. Cheering for the protagonist, therefore, feels satisfyingly cathartic,\u201d he adds. \n\n\n\n\n\n Rise of thrillers Amid the slow-burn romances and fun comedies, K-dramas are tackling subjects that highlight the ills plaguing their society. And the interest in such horror-thrillers has been picking up recently. Like Squid Game, the super hit 2019 zombie series, Kingdom \u2014 directed by Kim Seong-hun, and set in the 16th century \u2014 is ironically predictive of the future. Though it follows the story of a kingdom afflicted by a mysterious plague that turns people into zombies, Bae Doona, one of the stars of the show, admits that the period drama (all set for Season 3) is also a telling tale of the current times we live in.

Interestingly, director Dong-hyuk admits that Squid Game was rejected by studios 10 years ago, when he first wrote the pilot (inspired by his own debt-ridden state). \u201cAt the time, it seemed unfamiliar, too violent, complicated and not commercially viable,\u201d he said, during the show\u2019s promotions. Today, however, it\u2019s these very traits, \u201creflective of the times we live in\u201d, that is finding its fans. Filmmaker Vijayeta Kumar, who watched the show twice, says that the horror and gore in it \u201cisn\u2019t just the deaths, but what capitalism and greed do to you\u201d. \u201cThe horror of poverty, being debt-ridden to the extent you have to sign away your own body, and not being able to fit into a class-conscious society, is, for me, the real scary part,\u201d she says. Squid Game has struck a raw nerve as South Korea grapples with increasing household debt, income inequality and lack of employment. It has also found resonance across the world because many have been facing severe financial crisis over the last few decades. And now the pandemic has seen many lose their jobs, businesses and source of income. For people grappling with mental stress and anxiety, the extreme representation of it on screen seems to have triggered varied reactions. Talking numbersThe number of social mentions of Squid Game had increased to 331% in the second week since its launch, with anger, sadness and joy being the three most used emojis by netizens to express themselves.Courtesy: Cision Social Listening Dr Kamna Chibber, Head of Mental Health and Behavioural Sciences at Fortis Healthcare has had several clients discuss the show\u2019s premise with her. \u201cPeople identify with parts they feel are reflective of the reality of the world they occupy, that are easy for them to make sense of,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, it is also important to recognise that there are people who do not identify with the media they consume and are not attracted to the same.

Cut to 2021 and we have a generation that has come to the conclusion that such shows are probably retellings of our world in terrifying circumstances.  And Foundation could very well be one of them.  Also Read | Get \u2018First Day First Show\u2019, our weekly newsletter from the world of cinema, in your inbox. You can subscribe for free here Deeply entrenched in all-too-familiar political messes and struggles for power, Foundation also taps into futurism with genetic dynasties and time travel. As far as adaptations can go, the series created by Josh Friedman and David S. Goyer is a dramatic divergent from the books \u2013 actually veering towards the prequel books \u2013 while still the central plot is kept the same: a mathematician and developer of psychohistory, Hari Seldon (Jared Harris) predicts the end of the Galactic Empire, much to the dismay of the Empire (Lee Pace). Hari then forms The Foundation, a group of remarkable minds who can help him and the universe preserve civilisations for centuries to come.  While the diverse cast reflects a potentially globalised world \u2014 or universe, in this case \u2014 there is a pushed tone of \u2018wokeness\u2019 in every debate. Too much of it lends preachy messaging; and today\u2019s audiences know when they are being lectured, not just entertained. This could have been treated with more subtlety. Lou Llobel, playing Hari\u2019s protege Gaal Dornick, conveys both innocence and defiance impressively on screen. Llobel\u2019s portrayal of Gaal\u2019s journey of strength is a delight to watch, making her an international talent to watch for the years to come.  The same goes for Leah Harvey\u2019s depiction of Salvor Hardin. In each scene, Harvey leaves audiences wanting more, without bringing much ego to Salvor \u2013 a game-changing choice given the character goes through waves of uncertainty as she fights for what she believes is right and tries to also find out more about herself and why she has a connection to the future.  Also Read | Kubbra Sait on why \u2018Foundation\u2019 marked \u2018monumental growth\u2019 for her as an actor and a person While most series tend to sideline South Asian actors save for a scene or two for token\u2019s sake, Foundation has done well with Kubbra Sait\u2019s Phara Keaen. The Anacreon extremist strike team leader is not just an angry entity, but someone who genuinely believes that what she is doing is right for her people. Sait does well to breathe life into the Grand Huntress; her chemistry with on-screen rival Salvor works well with their intense interactions and occasional tussle.  While most leaders on-screen brim with perfection, Jared Harris brings vulnerability and humanity to Hari Seldon. As audiences, we are not too sure of Hari, especially given we see him through Gaal\u2019s eyes. I was pleased that there was no cliched paternal vibe with Hari, keeping his role as tight as possible thus opening up more dialogue into his work as a psycho-historian which audiences want to know more of.  Lee Pace does what he does best: taking ownership of his role \u2013 or roles, plural, rather. As a series of genetic clones of variants of Cleon, his screen presence is impactful. Goyer and Pace bring to life our fear of clones; that there will be too many of them and one day, one of the said clones will inevitably want something more for himself and his legacy, i.e. to be a clone above others. Even in the most simple scene, Pace brings his all.  The world designs across Foundation are stunning; and Goyer makes sure audiences feel every cinematic punch, be the panoramic scene of Gaal travelling through the Starbridge or the different planets and their distinctive looks, down to the architecture, weaponry and costumes. A lot of screentime is devoted to helping the audience get to know these new surroundings and rightfully so; but be sure to dedicate Foundation to your television or other bigger screens only to feel the magnitude of each and every detail.  But do not expect constant and large-scale warfare all the time; while Foundation has many a fight scene, the stories are more dialogue-driven The industry has shelled out its unfair share of disastrous remakes and adaptations, so you might be thinking reductively if you assumed Apple TV+ was playing it safe with Foundation. Rather, for such a beloved series of books, the pressure is extremely high. Given the scale of Asimov\u2019s work, Goyer and his team justified \u2013 and even magnified \u2013 a lot of what was on the page. And, there is a strong paving for a second season.  Foundation is streaming on Apple TV+ with new episodes every week.

Yulia Peresild, 37, and Klim Shipenko, 38, landed as scheduled on Kazakhstan's steppe. Mr.Shipenko appeared distressed but smiling as he exited the capsule, waving his hand to cameras before being carried off by medical workers for an examination. Ms. Peresild, who plays the film's starring role and was selected from some 3,000 applicants, was extracted from the capsule to applause and a bouquet of flowers. The actress said she is \"sad\" to have left the ISS. \"It seemed that 12 days was a lot, but when it was all over, I didn't want to leave,\" she told Russian television. \"This is a one-time experience,\u201d she added.  The team was ferried back to terra firma by cosmonaut Oleg Novitsky, who had been on the space station for the past six months.  The filmmakers had blasted off from the Russia-leased Baikonur Cosmodrome in ex-Soviet Kazakhstan earlier this month, travelling to the ISS with veteran cosmonaut Anton Shkaplerov to film scenes for \"The Challenge\".  If the project stays on track, the Russian crew will beat a Hollywood project announced last year by \"Mission Impossible\" star Tom Cruise together with NASA and Elon Musk's SpaceX. The Russian movie's plot, which has been mostly kept under wraps along with its budget, centres around a surgeon who is dispatched to the ISS to save a cosmonaut. Shkaplerov, 49, along with the two Russian cosmonauts who were already aboard the ISS are said to have cameo roles in the film. The mission was not without small hitches. As the film crew docked at the ISS earlier this month, Mr. Shkaplerov had to switch to manual control.  And when Russian flight controllers on Friday conducted a test on the Soyuz MS-18 spacecraft the ship's thruster fired unexpectedly and destabilised the ISS for 30 minutes, a NASA spokesman told the Russian news agency TASS. The team's landing, which was documented by a film crew, will also feature in the movie, Konstantin Ernst, the head of the Kremlin-friendly Channel One TV network and a co-producer of \"The Challenge\", told AFP. Russian firsts  The mission will add to a long list of firsts for Russia's space industry. The Soviets launched the first satellite Sputnik, and sent into orbit the first animal, a dog named Laika, the first man, Yuri Gagarin and the first woman, Valentina Tereshkova. But compared with the Soviet era, modern Russia has struggled to innovate, and its space industry is fighting to secure state funding with the Kremlin prioritising military spending.  Its space agency is still reliant on Soviet-designed technology and has faced a number of setbacks, including corruption scandals and botched launches. Russia is also falling behind in the global space race, facing tough competition from the United States and China, with Beijing showing growing ambitions in the industry. Russia's Roscosmos was also dealt a blow after SpaceX last year successfully delivered astronauts to the ISS, ending Moscow's monopoly for journeys to the orbital station.  In a bid to spruce up its image and diversify its revenue, Russia's space programme revealed this year that it will be reviving its tourism plan to ferry fee-paying adventurers to the ISS.  After a decade-long pause, Russia will send two Japanese tourists -- including billionaire Yusaku Maezawa -- to the ISS in December, capping a year that has been a milestone for amateur space travel.

Subramaniam, albeit trained professionally as a lawyer, took to the immensely powerful medium cinema to experiment with and used it as a tool to spread social awareness. Seva Sadanam, a picture produced by him as soon he entered the field, was to be the vehicle to carry the message about the state of women and their dismal position in society. Based on a novel by Munshi Premchand, it highlighted the plight of a young girl married to an gentleman old enough to be her father. Scenes and dialogues unprecedented in this medium were posited in the film, and it propelled Subramaniam into the arena as a champion of social causes. When the freedom movement started by Gandhiji gained momentum, Subramaniam jumped into the fray and released his much-lauded movie Thyaga Bhoomi, which after a considerable run, was banned by the British government for containing objectionable messages against the state. It was little wonder that, born to such a tycoon of Tamil Cinema and having been educated in communication skills at the best known University in the United States., Dr. S. Krishnaswamy set for himself the goal of introducing purposeful themes in his productions, though he could have become a commercially successful filmmaker by turning out films that would fetch the best financial returns \u2014 the base was readily available as his father was well-known in the film industry and had an established company. He founded his firm Krishnaswamy Associates in 1963, with documentary films as its staple fare and a motto that read, \u201cWe film to build bridges of brotherhood; we shoot to destroy walls of prejudice\u201d. In 1960, as a 22-year-old, Krishnaswamy joined the Columbia University in the U.S., and studied Mass Communications with special reference to documentary films. It was 60 years later in 2020, that the Government of India honoured him with the coveted Dr. V.Shantaram Lifetime Achievement Award for his contribution to documentary films at the Mumbai International Film Festival (MIFF). Through tedious decades of his life, he stood firm in his belief and eventually received many awards; the Honor Summus Award of the Watumull Foundation, Hawaii, the Lifetime Achievement Award in 2005 at the U.S. International Film & Video Festival, Los Angeles, in 1987, the Padma Shri in 2009, and several other awards including National awards for his documentaries. He reportedly showed his grit and national spirit even as a student in the U.S. When, during an open film screening at the university, a movie from the March of Time series about India happened to portray the country in poor light, Krishnaswamy is said to have angrily strode to the podium, picked up the microphone and declared, \u201cThis is stupid. The film is nonsense!\u201d And when a professor attempted to pacify the young Krishnaswamy and advised him to make a film that would depict the real India, he is said to have asserted: \u201cIndeed, I will,\u201d That was the turning point in his life. It changed the perspective, and later he kept the promise in its very spirit. When he was writing the book Indian Film in collaboration with Professor Erik Barnouw, they had camped in Darjeeling for a few weeks where Satyajit Ray was filming his Kanchenjunga. Thus, early in his life he not only developed a great regard for the icon but also a lasting friendship with him despite the age difference and this would prove to be a great aid in the pursuit of his chosen ideology. He shot into the limelight with his four-hour-long docu-film, Indus Valley to Indira Gandhi, which traversed 5,000 years of subcontinental history, and received high International acclaim even as Warner Brothers acquired the rights for its distribution.  \n\n\n\n \u00a0 This, his magnum opus, received high praise abroad and later \u2014 the work did not go uncriticised in his own country \u2014 in India too. Though the title marked out a period between two important points of history, it was misconstrued by some to be part of Indira Gandhi\u2019s emergency propaganda, though the concept had been conceived and the title announced long before The Emergency was declared. Due to financial reasons, it could be released only in 1976, when M/s Warner Bros bought and controlled the film rights for two decades, after which the rights reverted to the producer. Among those who admired the film were L.K. Advani and Sushma Swaraj, then from the opposition party. His wife, Dr. Mohana, is an internationally recognised Research Scientist who chose to leave her carreer and join Krishnaswamy in his artistic endeavours. An accomplished Hndustani musician and scholar in Hindi literature, she found it easy to assist her husband by taking up several creative and administrative responsibilities. The journey was not through a bed of roses. She joined him in tough projects that entailed a traumatic experience, such as the time they filmed After a 1000 Days of Terror, a film that delved into the infamous Operation Blue star, analysing the events that led to this unfortunate but unavoidable army action in Amritsar Golden Temple in 1984. They had tense moments of filming some actual military operations. The film was screened abroad to explain to the global audience the circumstances in which the Indian Army had to enter a sanctified place. Dr. Mohana\u2019s assistance came in very handy as she had a good command over Hindi and was able to assuage the concerns of those inclined to be hostile about what they intended to project in the film. Another tough project was in 1987, when a film titled Paradise Regained was made on the ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka for which the couple and their team interviewed leaders from both sides like Prabhakaran and Sinhalese political leaders of the day. \u00a0\n\n\n \u00a0 Mohana proved her individual worth as a filmmaker by securing the first prize from the International Federation of University Women at Helsinki for the first documentary she independently directed, How They Left Hell Behind, which was based on the status of Women in Tamil Nadu. To quench his desire for producing a film on the social history of Tamil Nadu, Krishnaswamy wrote story, screenplay and dialogue for a 52-episode serial called Visalam (2002), which covered five matrilineal generations of a family. His daughters too carried forward the parents\u2019 efforts by producing documentaries of their own. When his daughter Latha\u2019s film on the WIA was screened to an august audience, late Dr. Shanta, the spirit behind the Cancer Institute, was present, and is said to have mentioned as an aside to Central Minister Nirmala Sitaraman on the dais that Krishnaswamy was in the audience. With a spontaneity rarely seen in a VVIP, the Minister then told the audience: \u201cIndus Valley to Indira Gandhi was the first ever authentic movie on history, and all of us benefitted by seeing it again and again. That was a great service rendered \u2014 the kind of which India has always been proud of.\u201d Diversifying into production of TV serials in the 1980s, Krishnaswamy Associates deliberately chose its themes and canvas without losing its core ideology. Starting with serials based on Jayakanthan\u2019s novels and short stories, over the years, they have made serials based on several popular Tamil authors. Merging the Tamil twin epics, Silappathigaram and Manimegalai, the couple made Hindi serial Upasana in 1992. Dr. Ma.Po. Sivagnanam, an authority on the epics, observed: \u201cI am thrilled with the manner in which this serial projects the culture of Tamil Nadu to the rest of India. Dr. Krishnaswamy and Dr. Mohana deserve the highest praise from a grateful Tamilnadu for this contribution.\u201d Latha and Gita, both acclaimed dancers, blossomed into successful tele-film producers with their early serials directed by the parents. The firm produced two serials of Indian dance for a television channel in Singapore totalling 33 episodes, featuring over 150 artistes from all genres of Indian classical dance as well as folk dances. Directed by Latha and Gita, the serial won the Certificate of Creative Excellence at the U.S. International Film and Video Festival. Yet again, the firm received another prestigious international Award for the dance interpretation of Aurobindo\u2019s Savitri, written by Krishnaswamy and choreographed and performed by his daughters.  A relaxed Krishnaswamy now remembers a pioneer explorer of the Arctic region, whose frozen body was recovered almost a decade after he died from the depths of snow. In his handwritten pocket diary, which was found intact, he had scribbled: \u2018The joy is in the exploration more than in the applause which may follow.\u2019  \u00a0 Many of the over 250 documentaries that Krishnaswamy has been connected with have won accolades, starting with one of his earliest I which was an experimental one that won, in addition to praise from former Prime Minister I.K. Gujral, the Special National Award to mark the Silver Jubilee of Independence as the best short film of 25 years. Unknown Freedom Fighters was another bold production for which Krishnaswamy interviewed forgotten participants in the freedom struggle from across India, including those who had represented or taken part in various struggles between 1915 and 1946. Other notable films by him include When the Waves Came, which is about the 18th century Indian Renaissance and Four Ideals, on different phases of the struggle, a study of the Indian film industry in Through a Different Lens on the subconscious role of Indian Cinema in the colonial era, and Ezhu Thalaimurai Ezhuchi (7 generations of strife), a docu-drama TV serial on the role of the Tamils in the Freedom Struggle. The latter did come in for some criticism \u2014 it was even made into a court case by some political leaders only to be cleared by the Madras High Court. The proof of the pudding was when The Hindu wrote about the serial as \u201cA panoramic montage [...] exceptionally well-done, always lucid, with a touch of poetry at need [....] while the values it stresses are the kind that need loud reiteration\u201d. In the 1990s, he produced Jaya Jaya Sankara, a 30-minute documentary on the history of the Kanchi Kamakoti Mutt, from Adi Shankara to the 68th pontif Paramacharya Chandrashekharendra Saraswati, and a 4-part docu-serial India-5555 on five millennia of civilisational values, five centuries of history, five decades of democracy and five years of a new economic policy, which won the viewership of world leaders (including Bill Clinton) and praise from celebrities. Another one that won appreciation was Reality Behind Religion, a motivational film for religious harmony, for which over a dozen revered icons were interviewed, including the Dalai Lama, Mother Teresa, Acharya Tulsi, Swami Ranganathananda (Head of Ramakrishna Math) and Zakir Husain (former Vice President of India). It is to his credit that he made biographical documentaries on Rajaji, Kamaraj, Ramana Maharishi, R. Venkatraman, C. Subramaniam, MGR, and his own father Director K Subrahmanyam. Of course, the crowning glory of this was the 52-episode Tamil, docu-drama Swami Vivekananda featuring over 150 artistes, telecast in 2013-14, scripted by Krishnaswamy and directed by his daughter Gita. \u00a0\n\n\n\n His oeuvre was of great variety; in fact, he left no stone unturned as he produced industrial, agricultural, educational, social and motivational films, besides some promotional films. In fact, the first National Award he received in 1968 was for his production of an industrial film on Neyveli Lignite. He, however, remembers with great pride and satisfaction, one particular serial, which has remained deeply etched in the filmmaker\u2019s psyche as his most important contributions \u2014 the set of films on South East Asia tracing the impact of the ancient Indian civilisation on Indonesia, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. That was the 18-episode serial titled Indian Imprints (2007) and a feature-length documentary titled A Different Pilgrimage (2009), which was first screened at the Indian Pavilion of the Cannes International Film Festival in 2010. Of the mentioned above, Indian Imprints was commissioned by Doordarshan while the individual films on countries were commissioned by the Ministry of External Affairs. As the firm celebrates its 58th year in existence, he is, along with the family members, contemplating making a film on Subramania Bharati in Hindi. He is happy that the spirit of the family is maintained by his daughters; Latha directed a documentary titled 5000 Years in 50 Minutes for the Films Division which received international acclaim. Three more recent films, written and directed by her, are strong indications that she will lead the company to the next level. Her film, A Different Language, about the Dr. MGR Home and Higher Secondary School for the Speech and Hearing Impaired, won the prestigious international Cannes Corporate and Media Award in 2018 and her Ancient Future on revival of ancient arts and culture, with special reference to Vasthu Shastra is critically acclaimed. Her film Vedic GPS was screened at the Esoteric International Film Festival, Moscow in February 2021. A relaxed Krishnaswamy now remembers a pioneer explorer of the Arctic region, whose frozen body was recovered almost a decade after he died from the depths of snow.

via a press release the highly encouraging news of an interim analysis of a phase-3 trial using the antiviral drug molnupiravir, the company has submitted an emergency use authorisation application to the FDA. Preliminary data, which is yet to be peer-reviewed, shows molnupiravir can reduce risk of hospitalisation or death by 50% in non-hospitalised adult patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 disease. That molnupiravir is an oral drug is a major advantage in treating patients as it would not require hospitalisation. In an email, Dr. Gagandeep Kang, Professor of Microbiology at CMC, Vellore, explains the other advantages that the drug will have, if granted an EUA. Yes, molnupiravir has significant promise. But there are some concerns about how early and how mild the disease has to be for molnupiravir to work. It seems important to treat within the first few days of diagnosis or symptoms and the drug does not work towards the more severe end of the spectrum, including what is considered moderate disease. The study was designed to include people with at least one risk factor for severe disease, because the goal was to study progression to severe disease. Had completely healthy people been included the study size would have needed to be much larger to get clear outcomes. Merck\u2019s selection strategy of people at risk of severe disease led to a clear answer on efficacy in mild disease, such that the study was stopped for efficacy with data on 775 people. Molnupiravir is a pro-drug, which means that it needs to undergo processing in the body to become active. It is metabolised to a ribonucleoside analog, which is essentially a sugar molecule linked to a molecule that resembles a nucleic acid. Nucleic acids are needed to make RNA, and if molnupiravir is used, the viral enzyme instead of using real cytidine or uridine uses a molecule that is generated by metabolism of molnupiravir called NHC-TP. The virus has a proof-reading mechanism but the viral exnuclease which is responsible for removing mistakes does not recognize NHC-TP as an error, so that when the viral RNA polymerase is making copies of RNA that contains molnupiravir, then it randomly replaces cytidine or uridine. This causes more mutations that can be survived by the virus or it becomes unable to replicate \u2014 this is called lethal mutagenesis or error catastrophe. A Phase IIa study conducted earlier this year showed a reduction in viral load in the upper respiratory tract, which will indirectly reduce transmission. The drug has performed well against influenza in animal studies and was set to go into phase-1 trials in 2020. It has also worked well against Ebola and Chikungunya. It is always possible for a virus to develop mutations that will render an antiviral ineffective, but molnupiravir\u2019s mode of action makes it a little less likely than for many other antivirals. If multiple antivirals are available then using a combination that targets different steps in the replication of the virus is the best way to delay the development of resistance. Both remdesivir and molnupiravir target the same enzyme but in different ways, so while ideal to have the same target, it may be worthwhile to test a combination therapy, with the caveat that giving IV infusions as required for remdesivir negates the ease and reach of an oral drug such as molnupiravir. There are opinions that molnupiravir may potentially drive mutagenesis in viral RNA and mammalian DNA. Scientists from Emory who developed the drug say they have not seen any evidence of mutagenicity. In April 2021, Merck reported results of preclinical research using assays that should identify the ability of drugs to induce mutations \u2014 animals were given molnupiravir at high doses and for longer times than in human clinical trials, and no evidence of mutagenicity or genotoxicity was found. But the clinical trials excluded pregnant and breastfeeding women and required men to not donate sperm and required either abstinence or contraception for all genders. With eight Indian companies manufacturing the drug, I assume it will become accessible, but indiscriminate use should be prevented. The last thing we want is for a promising drug to become useless if it is inappropriately used, as happens all too often with antibiotics in India. The drug is not yet in the market and vaccine supply is increasing so this is not an either/or situation. An antiviral to be used in early treatment of an infected person with 50% efficacy in those with conditions predisposing to severity has a role that is very different from vaccines that are intended to protect prior to exposure. Restricting the drug to unvaccinated individuals makes no sense whatsoever, but using it for people at risk does. The reason for not giving it to vaccinated individuals in the trial was because vaccination reduces the risk of progression to severe disease, which is what the trial wanted to measure. But once the trial is done, we want to prevent progression to severe disease in all infected individuals, vaccinated or unvaccinated. Vaccinated individuals who are older and have co-morbidities continue to have a higher risk of severe disease and certainly should be given the drug if they develop symptoms, The Indian definition was 90-93% oxygen saturation for moderate disease, while anything lower than 93% would be considered severe in the US. The important thing about definitions in trials is that they should be the same measured using the same protocol.

While nothing yet has been established in a court of law, the episode is one more instalment in what appears to be a new drama series unleashed by the guardians of our public space \u2014 a war on Bollywood.  \u00a0\n\n\n\nWatch | Shashi Tharoor on the targeting of Bollywood\n\n\n \n\n\n   Last year, there was an all-out assault on the character of starlet Rhea Chakraborty who, after months of media frenzy linking her to the death by suicide of her boyfriend, actor Sushant Singh Rajput, was arrested and detained for several days for allegedly buying drugs for him, claims she denied and which were never substantiated. This in turn had already led to a huge campaign against alleged drug abuse in Bollywood, with four other actresses being called in for questioning. No charges were made, but the process, as is so often the case, proved to be the punishment. \n\n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nRakul Preet Singh appears before ED in drugs case \n\n\n\n\u00a0 \nRakul Preet Singh appears before ED in drugs case  But it is not just drugs that have been used to smear the film industry. In January this year, at least 10 police complaints were filed, in more than half a dozen States across the country, against film-makers, actors and Amazon executives of a made-for-television political drama called Tandav, which allegedly offended Hindu sensibilities by its depiction of a character portraying Lord Shiva. Another crime thriller, Mirzapur, underwent similar harassment, for similar reasons; A Suitable Boy had cases filed against it over a kissing scene filmed near a temple. In March this year, properties linked to film-maker Anurag Kashyap, actress Tapsee Pannu and Reliance Entertainment group CEO Shibhashish Sarkar were raided by the Income Tax department as part of a tax evasion investigation against a company, Phantom Films, that had been dissolved in 2018. The alarm bells have begun to go off in the minds of some in our political class. Maharashtra Minister Nawab Malik has alleged that the raids were an attempt to suppress the voices of those who speak against the central government. Jaya Bachchan \u2014 a one-time movie star herself, wife of megastar Amitabh Bachchan, and a member of the Rajya Sabha \u2014 decried a \u201cconspiracy to defame the film industry\u201d. The latest media campaign against Aryan Khan suggests the conspiracy is still alive. As these allegations suggest, it is not really drugs that are the issue here for the powers-that-be. The alleged violation of our narcotics laws is merely a convenient cudgel to batter an industry that is disliked for other reasons. The political establishment recognises the outsize influence of Bollywood entertainment on the minds and attitudes of the broad viewing \u2014 and voting \u2014 public. What those in power, who have demonstrated their intolerance of points of view other than their own for some time now, really dislike is not what Bollywood does behind closed doors, but the content of what it puts out \u2014 what one might call the political culture of Bollywood. \n\n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nNCB arrests drug peddler, to probe his role in drug case linked to Sushant\u2019s death\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \nNCB arrests drug peddler, to probe his role in drug case linked to Sushant\u2019s death\n When I wrote my novel Show Business in 1990, some Indian critics were surprised that I would follow The Great Indian Novel with a work that dealt with the trashy world of commercial Bombay cinema. But I did so because to me, Indian films, with all their limitations and outright idiocies, represented a vital part of the hope for India\u2019s future. In a country that is still perhaps 30% illiterate, films represent the prime vehicle for the transmission of popular culture and values. Cinema offers all of us in India a common world to which to escape, allowing us to dream with our eyes open. And with 570 million Internet users, India also offers a remarkable market for new cinema for the OTT (over-the-top) platforms \u2014 direct to our laptops and mobile phone screens \u2014 a market Bollywood is poised to dominate. In India, popular cinema has consistently reflected the diversity of the pluralist community that makes this cinema. The stories they tell are often silly, the plots formulaic, the characterisations superficial, the action predictable, but they are made and watched by members of every community in India. Muslim actors play Hindu heroes, South Indian heroines are chased around trees by North Indian rogues. Representatives of some communities may be stereotyped (think of the number of alcoholic Christians played by a \u201ccharacter actor\u201d like Om Prakash), but good and bad are always shown as being found in every community. \n\n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nKaran Johar: I do not consume narcotics or encourage consumption of any such substance\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \nKaran Johar: I do not consume narcotics or encourage consumption of any such substance\n I was first struck by this quality of Bollywood not long after the Bangladesh War, when the 1973 film Zanjeer offered a striking pointer to me of what Bollywood had come to represent in our society. In the film, Pran played Badshah Khan, a red-bearded Pathan Muslim who exemplified the values of strength, fearlessness, loyalty and courage. This was just a year after the bloody birth of Bangladesh in a war in which most of the subcontinent\u2019s Pathans were on the other side, but far from demonising the Pran figure, the film-makers chose not just to portray a strong Muslim character but to make him the most sympathetic presence in the film after the hero. This would not have been possible in many other countries, but Bollywood tended to be consistently good at this sort of thing, making megahits like Amar Akbar Anthony, about three brothers separated in infancy who are brought up by different families \u2014 one a Christian, one a Hindu and one a Muslim. The message was clear \u2014 that Christians, Hindus and Muslims are metaphorically brothers too, seemingly different but united in their common endeavours for justice. This kind of message is unsurprising, given who makes these films. Many have observed that Muslims enjoy a disproportionate influence in Bollywood, most apparent in the dominance of the trio of actors Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan, and Aamir Khan for three decades (six of the 10 highest-grossing films ever made feature one of the Khans). Several other prominent Bollywood stars \u2014 Naseeruddin Shah, Saif Ali Khan and the late Irrfan Khan \u2014 are Muslim. None of them was invited when, in 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi conducted a famous photo-op with a couple of dozen Bollywood A-list personalities flown to New Delhi for the purpose. In today\u2019s charged political atmosphere, generated by the ascendancy of political figures associated with Hindutva, the photo-op suggested that the \u201cA\u201d in \u201cA-list\u201d seems increasingly to stand for \u201cappeasement\u201d of the authorities. Many Bollywood celebrities embarrassed themselves by participating in a Government-run social media campaign to denounce global celebrities like Rihanna and Greta Thunberg for their support to our agitating farmers, earning themselves the sobriquet \u201c#Sellebrities\u201d. \n\n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nKannada film industry and drugs | Cracking the world of make-believe\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \nKannada film industry and drugs | Cracking the world of make-believe\n The real problem is that the Sangh Parivar dislikes diversity, and the film world embodies the very idea of India\u2019s diversity in the way in which it is organised, staffed, and financed \u2014 and in the stories it tells. Everything about Bollywood embodies the \u201ccomposite culture\u201d whose very existence is an affront to the uni-dimensional bigotry of Hindutva. And as India\u2019s entertainment has opened itself to more and more global influence, India\u2019s \u201cmainstream\u201d cinema has increasingly shown a capacity for tackling serious themes \u2014 caste discrimination, rural injustice, sanitation, women\u2019s rights, menstruation, female sexuality, interreligious marriage, homosexuality and even global Islamophobia have featured in recent films. This worries those who prefer Bollywood to continue to limit itself to formulaic entertainment, the proverbial \u201cbread and circuses\u201d necessary to distract the general public from governmental failures. The plot is thickening. New Internet guidelines, whose application and operations are yet to be tested, have already prompted Amazon Prime Video to suspend plans for a second season of the popular rural political series Paatal Lok. Other releases are reported to have been postponed indefinitely. Even the prospect of official disapproval has already had a chilling effect. Bollywood, which makes over 2,000 films a year, has long been India\u2019s calling card to the world of entertainment. Our films and TV shows have the capacity of going global on the small screen the way Korean cinema has but Chinese has not \u2014 because censorship and intimidation stifles one set of film-makers and not the other. The remarkable creative talents available in India could make the country a global leader for such worldwide offerings. But to do that we must allow our film-makers creative freedom, stop harassing them and cease encouraging media persecution. It is time to rise up in defence of Bollywood.

The 14th edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) that commenced on April 9 in India, drew to a halt on May 2 following COVID-19\u2019s debilitating second wave. After a break, the league found its concluding phase in the desert sands with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) hosting the remaining matches from September 19 to October 15. The context, venues and timelines changed, but for the IPL some truths seemed eternal. Chennai Super Kings (CSK) may not have as many titles as Mumbai Indians (MI) but when it comes to consistency, no other outfit can challenge M.S. Dhoni\u2019s men dressed in the yellow shade. CSK emerged champion with a swagger while ignoring the sarcasm around it being a \u2018Dad\u2019s Army\u2019 considering the veterans in its ranks starting with Dhoni at 40. Having finished seventh in the previous edition in the UAE, the Chennai unit had the odds stacked against it while defending champion MI with five titles, seemed poised to extend its legacy. But when the cricket caravan moved from India to the UAE, CSK remained the team to beat while MI failed to qualify for the play-offs. CSK claimed its fourth title and is just behind MI in the trophy sweepstakes.  In the final against Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), CSK held the momentum and the rival fell short by 27 runs. But, as Dhoni mentioned, it is tough to stay in the bottom half for a large part of the tournament and then qualify for the summit clash. KKR precisely did that under Eoin Morgan before stumbling in the climax. CSK\u2019s overwhelming experience as reflected in Dhoni, Dwayne Bravo, Faf du Plessis, Moeen Ali, Suresh Raina, Robin Uthappa and Ambati Rayudu, allied with youngsters like Ruturaj Gaikwad, proved to be a combination that kept its calm despite Twenty20\u2019s frenzied rush. With Shardul Thakur, Bravo, Deepak Chahar and Ravindra Jadeja chipping in as bowlers, CSK covered all bases. While KKR was the surprise packet, Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) and Delhi Capitals failed to break their trophy drought despite making it to the last four. The IPL\u2019s penchant to highlight fresh talent was evident too as Ruturaj, KKR\u2019s Venkatesh Iyer, RCB\u2019s Harshal Patel or Sunrisers Hyderabad speedster Umran Malik, to name a few, drew attention. While the league prospered, it is sobering to reflect upon bubble fatigue, a grim reality these days, which forced Chris Gayle to skip mid-way. Financially sound, the IPL however is at an emotional tipping point as the addition of two new franchises for the 2022 season would mean that the next player-auction can alter team-compositions and test fan loyalties.

Actor-director Suhasini is heading the jury, while eight-time national award winner and Kannada director P.

Declaring the award, Minister for Cultural Affairs Saji Cherian said that the award sends across a message that women coming forward in all walks of life, including in cinema, is the need of the time. Ms.Suhasini said that Kerala has to be appreciated for going ahead with organising the award during the COVID-19 pandemic period, providing inspiration for artistes. \u201cThe quality of all the films have been good.

The Government has also alleged that there has been a \u201cselective approach adopted by the publishing agencies to deliberately lower India\u2019s rank on the GHI 2021\u201d by relying on higher values of indicators such as stunting and wasting from different datasets available.

That order is now on hold as insurers have asked for time to design such policies and get the required regulatory permissions. The court\u2019s idea was for a multi-year policy with a bundle of covers. We had explained in Cover Note in the edition dated September 6, how such bundled, or package, policies can serve us better and can offer more efficient pricing.  Multi-year policies have the added advantage of protecting us from our own forgetfulness to keep our insurance renewed! Let us look at a few package and multi-year policies. A basic motor-vehicles policy from the point of view of what is mandated is the Third-party (TP) Liability policy. This is packaged with an own-damage cover to make a comprehensive policy and can be further bundled with a menu of other optional covers like personal accident for the occupants, no-depreciation cover, road-side assistance, a cover ensuring a service vehicle while yours is being repaired and so on. The bells and whistles come at an additional cost but have their utility. Multi-year motor-vehicle policies have also been available. A 10-year TP policy for two-wheelers was introduced in 2014, but hasn\u2019t caught on much. A multi-year cover for cars was introduced in July 2018 and made compulsory for new vehicles including two-wheelers, from June 2020. However, this was withdrawn in August that year. Health insurance policies have been offered for two and three-year terms for quite some time now. This is attractive because of the premium discount as well as the fact that one is protected against the premium increases that have become significant. Home-insurance policies have been package policies for the longest time. The Householders\u2019 Comprehensive, policy dating back to the nationalised era of general insurance, had ten different covers packaged as one, including even personal-accident cover for household staff and continues to be on offer and many further options are now available, including some multi-year policies. Package policies and multi-year policies lend a dimension of convenience and practicality to buying and maintaining our portfolio of insurance.  One more convenient insurance hack that will save our skins when we forget to renew is to fix convenient renewal dates. Life policies are often linked to birthdays or wedding anniversaries which makes it easy for people to remember. If your policy is linked to a tax benefit, more the reason you should meet the March 31 deadline and hence, its renewal date should give you enough breathing room.  You can ask your insurance firm to align all your policies to the same renewal date. They can do this by extending some policies/ cutting short others as a one-time exercise and bringing them all to the target date. If a single renewal date for all policies is too much of a financial outgo all at once, then spread them out to some on the first date of each quarter or a conveniently remembered trigger date. It could be timed for your Deepavali bonus date or the date of interest on a fixed deposit. And if you are like a significant number of people who misplace policies, ensure you have registered on your insurance company\u2019s website so that you can access policy details online for reference at the time of renewal, for checking details while filing your I-T returns or indeed, when you are filing a claim. You can pool all your policies from various insurers, life, health, motor and so on into an e-insurance account and have them all in one place at the click of a mouse. This demat account, available through any insurer and even other financial service entities, will also come in handy for any policy updates such as address change or registered mobile number will be updated across policies and across insurers with one piece of communication.

Greaves led a brilliant lower-order fightback with a 28-ball 45 as Scotland recovered from a hopeless situation to post 140 for nine in their first round Group B opener of the T20 showpiece. Invited to bat first, Scotland were reeling at 53 for six in the 12th over before Greaves added 51 runs with Mark Watt (22 off 17 balls) to prop up Scotland. In response, Bangladesh were stopped at 134 for seven in their allotted quota of 20 overs with Greaves returning excellent figures of 2/19 in three overs, which included the vitals wickets of star all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan (20) and the seasoned Mushfiqur Rahim (38). This is Scotland's second win in a World Cup, the first coming in the 2016 edition of the tournament against Hong Kong. Needing 24 runs off the final over bowled by medium-pacer Safyaan Sharif (0/26), Mahedi Hasan (13 not out) and Mohammed Saifuddin (5 not out) could not pull off a miracle. For Scotland, medium-pacer Brad Wheal (3/24 in four overs) and leg-spinner Greaves were the star performers with the ball, while Josh Davey (1/24) and Mark Watt (1/19) provided ample support. Watt also followed up his performance with the bat with a superb bowling show. Skipper Mahmudullah (23) and Afif Hossain (18) kept Bangladesh in the hunt with some innovative shots. Left-hander Hossain went for a big one off left-arm spinner Watt only to see Davey take a catch in the deep. The Bangladesh batters did not have it easy against a disciplined Scotland attack. Soumya Sarkar (5) went for a big shot and failed to clear the fielder to leave Bangladesh at 8 for one. Liton Das (5) too did not last too long, falling to a slower one from Wheal. The experienced Shakib helped Mushfiqur add 47 runs for the third wicket before mis-hitting a half-tracker from Greaves for McLeod to run in and take a good catch. Mushfiqur, another of the team's vastly experienced player, opened up after a period of consolidation and hit two splendid sixes and looked to be in control before an attempted scoop shot off a good length delivery from Greaves saw his leg-stump knocked back to put Bangladesh in a spot of bother. Earlier, Scotland were off to a poor start as they lost skipper Kyle Coetzer (0) to Saifuddin with just five runs on the board in the third over. The spinners \u2014 Shakib and Mahedi Hasan \u2014 then took over and added to Scotland's woes. Hasan snared two wickets in his first over as he dismissed wicketkeeper Matthew Cross (11) and George Munsey (29) after the two had added 40 runs for the second wicket. This was after a brilliant display by Bangladesh bowlers in the power play as they restricted Scotland to 39 for one in the first six overs. Shakib joined the party by getting rid of Richie Berrington (2) and Michael Leask (0) to leave Scotland tottering at 52 for five, which soon became 53 for six when Hasan picked up his third wicket in the form of Calum MacLeod (5). Greaves, who hit four fours and two sixes, then came to their rescue with his runs to propel Scotland.

Winter is yet to set in. But natural gas prices soared over the past few months, especially in Europe. The price of natural gas in Europe is now six times higher than what it was last year. Across the continent, natural gas inventories are falling. On Wednesday, the benchmark Dutch gas futures price jumped 40% in the morning trade to touch \u20ac162.13 a megawatt-hour, an eight-year high, but reversed course after Russian President Vladimir Putin assured Europe of supplies. But even after the day\u2019s fall, gas prices in Europe remained twice as high as they were a month earlier. And on Friday, prices started rising again. What\u2019s driving up the prices? Also read: Explained | How bad is the world\u2019s energy crisis? A host of reasons, from economic recovery to geopolitics, are attributed to the price rise. Global energy demand fell last year when economies slipped into COVID-induced lockdowns. When growth returned this year, especially to Asian economies, demand shot up and energy producers struggled to meet the growing demand, pushing up prices. Even in the U.S., the world\u2019s largest natural gas producer, prices rose from $1.7 per million British thermal units on March 31 to $6.3 per mBtu on October 5. Europe, which is heavily dependent on imports to meet its energy demand, was particularly hit hard. As part of Europe\u2019s shift towards cleaner energy, many countries had moved away from coal to gas to produce electricity. This increased Europe\u2019s reliance on gas. On the other side, the continent\u2019s natural gas production has shrunk over the years, as many countries shut down production fields over environmental concerns. If Europe\u2019s natural gas production (excluding Russia) was about 300 billion cubic metres in 2005, it fell to less than 200 bcm in 2021, according to Rystad Energy. Norway, Europe\u2019s main producer of natural gas, has seen its production shrink from 117.6 bcm in 2015 to 105.3 bcm in 2021. This has left Europe largely dependent on Russia. As prices shot up amid growing worldwide demand and falling production in Europe, supplies from Russia via a pipeline that passes through Ukraine and Poland also shrank, which made the situation worse. Russia has built another gas pipeline, Nord Stream 2, which will take Russian gas directly to Germany bypassing Ukraine and Poland, whose governments are critical of the Kremlin. But supplies to Europe through Nord Stream 2 are yet to start as the pipeline is awaiting approval from European authorities. In the past when Europe\u2019s energy demand shot up, Russia had stepped up supplies. But this year, Gazprom, Russia\u2019s state-controlled energy giant that supplies about 35% of Europe\u2019s gas requirements, has booked less additional exports than the traders wanted, adding pressure on supplies. The International Energy Agency said this week Russian exports to Europe this year were lower than they were in 2019. This has fuelled speculation that Mr. Putin is using the energy crunch in Europe to get approval from the EU for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Several countries in Europe as well as the United States remain critical of the pipeline, which they say would help Russia enhance its leverage over the continent and would also allow Russia to economically punish Ukraine and Poland. U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told the BBC on Thursday any attempts by Russia to exploit the crisis would backfire. The Kremlin has dismissed such criticism, saying Russia has no role in the energy crunch. On Wednesday, Mr. Putin said the amount of gas flowing through the operational pipeline is set to exceed volumes agreed under Gazprom\u2019s contract with Ukraine. He also said Russia could \u201creach another record of deliveries of our energy resources to Europe, including gas\u201d. This temporarily calmed the markets. But Mr. Putin didn\u2019t say how Russia was going to step up supplies \u2014 through the existing pipeline or Nord Stream 2? Russian officials have already said Gazprom can send more gas to Europe if Nord Stream 2 comes online quickly. It is to be seen if additional supplies would be tied to a quick approval for the pipeline. Furthermore, the Russian domestic gas market also remains tight. Inventories are running low, and winter is coming, which would shoot up demand constraining Russia\u2019s export capacity. And demand is rising not only in Europe and the Americas, but also in Asia. Coal shortages in India and China could drive up prices of natural gas further.  \n\n\nWatch | India on the brink of a power crisis due to coal shortage\n\n\n \n\n\n\u00a0 ", "title": "Explained | Why natural gas prices are soaring - The Hindu", "author": "Stanly Johny", "date": "October 09, 2021 11:58 IST", "preprocessed": "suppos season winter natur price soar past month especi europ price natur europ time higher last year across contin natur inventori fall wednesday benchmark dutch futur price jump morn trade touch megawatt hour eight year high revers cours russian presid vladimir putin assur europ suppli even fall price europ remain twice high month earlier friday price start rise drive price also read explain world energi crisi host reason econom recoveri geopolit attribut price rise global energi demand fell last year economi slip covid induc lockdown growth return year especi asian economi demand shot energi produc struggl meet grow demand push price even world largest natur produc price rose million british thermal unit march mbtu octob europ heavili depend import meet energi demand particularli hard part europ shift toward cleaner energi mani countri move away coal produc electr increas europ relianc side contin natur product shrunk year mani countri shut product field environment concern europ natur product exclud russia billion cubic metr 2005 fell 2021 accord rystad energi norway europ main produc natur seen product shrink 2015 2021 left europ larg depend russia price shot amid grow worldwid demand fall product europ suppli russia pipelin pass ukrain poland also shrank made situat wors russia built anoth pipelin nord stream take russian directli germani bypass ukrain poland whose govern critic kremlin suppli europ nord stream start pipelin await approv european author past europ energi demand shot russia step suppli year gazprom russia state control energi giant suppli europ requir book addit export trader want pressur suppli intern energi agenc said week russian export europ year lower 2019 fuell specul putin energi crunch europ approv nord stream pipelin sever countri europ well unit state remain critic pipelin would help russia enhanc leverag contin would also allow russia econom punish ukrain poland nation secur advis jake sullivan told thursday attempt russia exploit crisi would backfir kremlin dismiss critic russia role energi crunch wednesday putin said amount flow oper pipelin exceed volum agre gazprom contract ukrain also said russia could reach anoth record deliveri energi resourc europ includ temporarili calm market putin russia step suppli exist pipelin nord stream russian offici alreadi said gazprom send europ nord stream come onlin quickli seen addit suppli would quick approv pipelin furthermor russian domest market also remain tight inventori winter come would shoot demand constrain russia export capac demand rise europ america also asia coal shortag india china could drive price natur watch india brink power crisi coal shortag"}, {"body": "Two months after the Taliban takeover of Kabul, New Delhi is planning to engage regional powers on the future of Afghanistan. It is sending an official team to attend the Moscow process of talks on October 20 that will include the Taliban government\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister. New Delhi has also invited regional National Security Advisers to Delhi for a meeting in November, including Pakistan's NSA Moeed Yusuf, in a rare departure from otherwise bitter bilateral ties. According to sources, New Delhi has reached out to countries that participated in the Iran-plus six-nation \u201cRegional Security Dialogue\u201d in Tehran- Iran, Russia, China, Pakistan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan for the meeting to be chaired by National Security Advisor Ajit Doval. A Pakistani official confirmed receiving the invitation, but said a decision on participation was yet to be taken.  The invitation to Pakistan for a multilateral format meeting follows weeks after a three-member Indian delegation participated in the Regional Anti-Terror Mechanism meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO-RATS) in Pakistan\u2019s Pabbi in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.  In another development, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla included Pakistan\u2019s Senate Chairperson in an invitation to parliamentary leaders of Commonwealth nations for the centennial celebration of the creation of the Public Accounts Committee of Parliament in early December. According to a number of verified reports, which the government has not denied, Mr. Doval has led a series of back-channel consultations with Pakistani military and security officials over the past year. A senior official told The Hindu that the invite to Pakistan comes amidst pressing need for discussions on terrorism and trans-national security emanating from the developments in Afghanistan and a surge in violent attacks inside that country, including two suicide bombings of mosques in Kunduz and Kandahar.  In addition, India wants to ensure that the issue of recognition of the Taliban government, which Pakistan has been pressing for, is only decided after the Taliban government gives assurances on terrorism, inclusivity in government and rights of women and minorities.  The Indian initiative, which comes after close consultations with Moscow, is significant given that thus far, the government has not announced any monetary or food aid for Afghanistan. Nor has it opened the door for Afghan refugees to India since the Taliban takeover.  However, speaking at the G-20 extraordinary conference on October 12, Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a strong pitch for international assistance for Afghanistan.  \u201cThe Prime Minister conveyed that every Indian feels the pain of Afghan people facing hunger and malnutrition. He emphasised the need for the international community to ensure that Afghanistan has immediate and unhindered access to humanitarian assistance,\u201d an Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) statement said.  The MEA has confirmed that India will send a senior official to the Moscow format conference on Wednesday, which includes delegations from Afghanistan, India, Iran, China and Pakistan. Taliban officials announced that a delegation led by its Deputy Prime Minister Abdul Salam Hanafi would attend the meeting. The Moscow meet will be the first time India is sending an official to attend a conference that includes the Taliban, after the fall of Kabul on August 15. The acceptance is significant because the SAARC Foreign Minister\u2019s conference, due to be held in September on the sidelines of the UNGA this year, was put off, reportedly due to India\u2019s objections to Pakistan\u2019s demand to allow a Taliban representative attend the meeting on Afghanistan\u2019s behalf.  Although no foreign government has recognised the Taliban as the official government, several, including India are in talks with them, mainly through their political office in Doha, while at least six nations, including Russia, China, Iran, Pakistan, Turkey and Qatar maintain embassies in Kabul.  Mr. Hanafi will travel to Moscow next week, and went on a one-day trip to Uzbekistan on Saturday to \u201cdiscuss trade and transit relations\u201d, Taliban\u2019s Deputy Minister for Information and Broadcasting Zabihullah Mujahid said in tweets.

(Sign up to our Technology newsletter, Today's Cache, for insights on emerging themes at the intersection of technology, business and policy. Click here to subscribe for free.) Amazon, for example, has been accused of using data from third-party sellers to determine what products it would create. Reuters reported on Wednesday, after reviewing thousands of internal Amazon documents, that the U.S. company's India operations ran a systematic campaign of creating knockoffs and manipulating search results to boost its own private brands in the country, one of the company\u2019s largest growth markets. The latest bill is one of a slew introduced in this Congress aimed at reining in tech firms, including industry leaders Facebook and Apple. Thus far none have become law although one, a broader measure to increase resources for antitrust enforcers, has passed the Senate. This bill, which Klobuchar's office said would be introduced early next week, would be a companion to a measure which has passed the House Judiciary Committee. It must pass both houses of Congress to become law. Klobuchar and Grassley's bill would specifically prohibit platforms from requiring companies operating on their sites to purchase the platform's goods or services and ban them from biasing search results to favour the platform.

Klobuchar is chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee while Grassley is the top Republican onthe full committee. Co-sponsors include Democrats like Senator Dick Durbin, chair of the full Judiciary Committee, Richard Blumenthal, Cory Booker, Mazie Hirono and Mark Warner as well as Republicans Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, Cynthia Lummis and Josh Hawley.

The new \u2018sub-compact SUV\u2019 plugs the size and segment gap between the Tiago NRG cross-hatchback and Nexon compact SUV.  The Punch is a front-wheel drive-only model but is designed to take on the worst of Indian roads. It has been conceived as an SUV from the ground up and gets the SUV family look, with the flat concave bonnet and split-headlamp layout establishing strong family ties with the larger Harrier and Safari. The gloss black grille is an enclosed panel with a tri-arrow-shaped opening for the horn behind. \n\n\n\n\n\n The Punch has a purposeful stance, and while the 16-inch diamond-cut alloys are attractive, they do not quite fill out the massive squared-out wheel wells. The thick side cladding, black pillars and roof break the monotone, and like the Altroz, the rear door handles are tucked in the C-pillar. Some might find the rear design a bit tame in comparison to the aggressive front, but the cool-looking tail-lamps with tri-arrow LED elements help the Punch stand out. Like other Tatas, the Punch also sports some fun Easter eggs for you to discover, like the one-horned rhinoceros\u2019 motif on the rear windscreen and glovebox. Compared to other compact SUVs, the Punch is smaller in dimension and has the same footprint as something like a Maruti Swift. However, its height is on par with a Tata Nexon and the high roof and upright pillars do help with that SUV-like look. The fresh and youthful exteriors are complemented by an equally stylish and exuberant interior. The layered dashboard design is pleasing to look at; the contrasting white panels, textured plastics and other materials not only look appealing, but also feel quite upmarket. The free-standing touchscreen, climate control buttons, steering, as well as the part-digital instrument cluster are shared with the Altroz premium hatchback. Ingress and egress are a breeze with the 90-degree-opening doors and high-set seating. The front seats are nice, although the cushioning is a bit firm and thigh support is limited for taller occupants. What is nice is that these seats can be jacked up to suit your requirements, while the low window line offer good visibility. The reversing camera with adaptive guidelines makes life easier while parking. Despite its compact size, rear seat space is comparable to the pricier Kia Sonet in terms of knee and shoulder room. There is adequate space for two six-footers to sit one behind the other, and what adds to comfort is the space beneath the front seats to tuck their feet. Rear headroom is in adequate supply for all but the tallest of occupants. A flat floor does add to the comfort of an occasional third passenger, however, the car\u2019s narrow width makes seating three abreast a tight squeeze. There is no rear air-con vent either. While its 7.0-inch touchscreen is feature-packed with Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, a crisp six-speaker Harman system, as well as (optional) connected car features, its touch interface and its responsiveness could have been slicker. Other equipment that the top-spec Punch packs in are automatic projector headlamps, LED DRLs, rain-sensing wipers, cruise control, electric folding mirrors, climate control, cooled glovebox, rear wiper and washer, 16-inch alloys, fog lamps with cornering function, and a security alarm, to name a few. There are abundant storage spaces, too, with cupholders dotted around the cabin, a massive glovebox and bottle holders in all doors. At 319-litres (366-litres if measured till the roof), the Punch\u2019s boot is almost the same size as that of a Maruti Brezza\u2019s, and owners also get the flexibility to fold down the rear seat. The Punch uses the same 1.2-litre, three-cylinder, naturally aspirated petrol engine as the Tiago, Tigor and Altroz, but the engine has been modified for this application. Tata has reworked the air intake with a ram-air system, aiming to enhance drivability. The engine makes a modest 86hp and 113Nm of torque, but factor in the Punch\u2019s 1,035kg kerb weight and the output comes across as more than reasonable. \n\n\n\n\n\n Enhancements to the engine and the switch to BS6 emission standards have resulted in a smoother power delivery, and generally the unit feels nicer than in its older iterations. It is quite smooth, although it still is not as refined or vibe-free as Maruti\u2019s K-series engines. The engine sounds grainy and there is a bit of three-cylinder thrum too, but to be fair, it only gets really vocal over 4,000rpm. What is nice is that the engine performs its daily duties with relative ease and its short gearing (first and second) makes it quite user-friendly, so it effortlessly closes gaps in traffic. Adopt a sedate driving style and it will perform the occasional highway duties satisfactorily. But demand for brisk performance and the engine feels out of its comfort zone. Quick overtaking manoeuvres will warrant careful planning and working the gearbox to make progress. The 5-speed manual is quite effort-free in its operation, but shifts aren\u2019t butter-smooth as some rivals. Thankfully, its clutch is light and easy to operate. The manual iteration is equipped with an engine start-stop feature which, in order to save fuel while idling, switches off the engine when the car comes to a halt. This system is slow to respond, hence you will need to depress the clutch and wait for the engine to restart before engaging a gear, else the system gets confused and the engine remains off. The other transmission option is the Marelli-sourced 5-speed automated manual transmission (AMT), which feels a lot more refined. The gearbox performs with relative smoothness, as far as AMTs go, and pauses between gearshifts are pretty well contained. The creep function is a bit eager but is easy to get accustomed to, and it is particularly useful in stop-go traffic. The Punch AMT is best driven in an unhurried manner. The gearbox has a tendency to upshift to the highest gear at the earliest (in the interest of fuel economy) and gets caught out by erratic throttle responses, resulting in annoying pauses while the transmission decides whether to shift to a lower gear. \n\n\n\n\n\n Another peculiarity is that while gradually slowing down from fourth gear, it occasionally continues rolling at the same speed and feels like the car is \u2018running away\u2019, thus compelling you to depress the brake pedal even harder to control its deceleration. The tiptronic mode does give more manual control, though even here the gearbox tends to upshift automatically. The Punch\u2019s ride and handling balance are spot on. There is an underlying toughness to its suspension, which shines while tackling rough and bad sections of road. It flattens the road like a much heavier car and its stability at high speeds is excellent. The steering of the Punch is light, consistent and accurate, but not overtly sharp like the Altroz. Its taut structure, light kerb weight and wonderful steering feel make it quite enjoyable around corners.  While driving enthusiasts will be left longing for stronger engine performance, a majority of owners will be satisfied with its overall packaging. Its brakes feel natural and progressive, and its braking performance inspires confidence.  Unique to the AMT version of the Punch is a Traction Pro mode, which essentially detects front wheel slippage and asks for permission to activate via a prompt on the touchscreen. Once permission is granted, the driver needs to press the brake and accelerator pedal at the same time, and the system will intelligently apply the brake to the wheel that has low or no traction, while the one with traction easily pulls the car out of the sticky situation. While the Punch is more capable than other hatchbacks at this price, it is still a front-wheel-drive car, and hence, it must not be subjected to conditions meant for four-wheel-drive vehicles. A hatchback with SUV pretensions is not unusual today, but the Tata Punch differentiates itself from the tribe with some of the attributes you would actually associate with the SUV body style. It has got the elevated seating and ample ground clearance you would expect, but also boasts of a fairly tough build and ability in challenging conditions. In other areas too, the Tata has a lot going for it \u2014 it is stylish on the outside, cheerful on the inside, packs in adequate space and practicality, as well as a reasonable equipment list. Engine performance is not exciting, and its AMT gearbox could have been a bit more intuitive, but these are likely to meet the requirements of a majority of buyers. And if Tata delivers on the expected price of \u20b9 5.5 to 8 lakh, the Punch, as a package, really punches above its weight and serves as a worthy, value for money alternative to hatchbacks such as the Maruti Swift and Hyundai Grand i10 Nios, as well as non-turbo compact SUVs such as Nissan Magnite, Renault Kiger, Hyundai Venue and Kia Sonet.

After nearly five-hour meeting, the CWC also announced an elaborate election schedule for organisational polls, according to which a new party president would be elected between August 21 and September 20 next year and thereafter, elections to the CWC would be held by October at the All India Congress Committee Plenary. \n\n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nDiabolical designs on farmers: Congress Working Committee\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \nDiabolical designs on farmers: Congress Working Committee\n Amid a chorus from party colleagues to take back the reins of the Congress again, Rahul Gandhi, for the first time after he quit in May 2019, said he \u201cwill consider it\u201d. But he also pointed out that that Congress should have clarity of thought and decide where it stands on the question of ideology. Mr. Gandhi then cited the example of the 2015 Dadri lynching incident and said he had wanted to visit the family of Akhlaq, the Muslim man who was lynched by a mob but was prevented as some in the party had reservations. Similar sentiments were expressed when he visited Hathras to meet the family of Dalit girl who was raped and murdered last year, he said. Mr. Gandhi is learnt to have said that when rights of the poor and marginalised sections are \u201cunder attack\u201d from the Narendra Modi government, the Congress should be able to defend them and not be concerned about \u201cwhose leadership is acceptable\u201d. \n\n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nGehlot\u2019s Delhi visit sparks speculation about Cabinet reshuffle\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \nGehlot\u2019s Delhi visit sparks speculation about Cabinet reshuffle\n Party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra was among a host of leaders who asked Mr. Gandhi \u201cto lead the action\u201d. But it was Ms. Gandhi\u2019s opening remarks that set the tone for the marathon meeting of the CWC, the first physical meeting after a gap of 18 months because of the pandemic. Her assertion of being a hands-on president was a direct rebuttal of senior leader Kapil Sibal\u2019s remarks that \u201cin our party, at the moment, there is no president\u201d. The entire organisation wanted its revival, but it required \u201cunity, discipline, self- control and keeping party\u2019s interest paramount,\u201d Ms. Gandhi stated. \u201cI am, if you will allow me to say so, a full-time and hands on Congress president,\u201d Ms. Gandhi observed. In the past two years, a large number of young colleagues have taken leadership roles in taking party policies and programmes to the people, she asserted. \n\n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy CWC didn\u2019t react to Dalit\u2019s murder at Singhu border, asks BJP\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \nWhy CWC didn\u2019t react to Dalit\u2019s murder at Singhu border, asks BJP\n \u201cI have always appreciated frankness. There is no need to speak to me through the media. So let us all have a free and honest discussion. But what should get communicated outside the four walls of this room is the collective decision of the CWC,\u201d she noted. Be it the farmers\u2019 agitation, relief provision during the pandemic, issues concerning youth and women, atrocities on Dalits, Adivasis and minorities, price rise, and the destruction of the public sector, the Congress chief pointed out the party had never shied away from raising issues of public importance and co-ordinating with like-minded parties on these issues. Ms. Gandhi stated that she was \u201cacutely conscious\u201d of the fact that she has been interim Congress President ever since the CWC asked her to return in this capacity in 2019 as the second wave of COVID overtook the country and this deadline was extended indefinitely. \u201cToday is the occasion for bringing clarity once and for all,\u201dshe said. Responding to her, Ghulam Nabi Azad and Anand Sharma, both members of the G-23, said there has never been any doubt over her leadership and that they were among the leaders who had requested her to take charge after Mr. Gandhi stepped down. While Mr Azad raised the issue of Mr Sibal's house coming under attack, sources said Mr Sharma had raised the issue of people leaving the Congress and the need to have a dialogue with them. Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, however, asserted those who can't take struggle and wish to leave the party can do so. Without naming the G-23, Jitender Singh, Ajay Maken and Randeep Surjewala were among the leaders who attacked them by pointing that there were seniors who were constantly questioning the party\u2019s decisions and leadership at public forums. Another CWC member, Tariq Hameed Karra, said the leadership of the Gandhi family was essential for \u201csaving democracy\u201d in the country. The leaders who requested Mr. Gandhi to take over the reins of the party included A.K. Antony, Ambika Sonia, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Channi, Chhatisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel, former Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar and AICC general secretary Harish Rawat. In her opening remarks, Ms. Gandhi also spoke about the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, the farmers\u2019 agitation, inflation, foreign policy and the continuing border stand-off with China, targeted killing in Jammu and Kashmir and the disinvestment process.

It made its recommendations based on the results from a pilot programme administering the vaccine to children in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi. Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by micro-organisms that belong to the genus Plasmodium, and is transmitted by infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. In 2019, according to the WHO, there were an estimated 229 million cases of malaria, and the estimated deaths were 4,09,000. About 67% of the deaths were among children aged under five, the group most vulnerable to malaria. Furthermore, 94% of the cases and deaths due to malaria occurred in the WHO African region, a disproportionately high share of the burden. But the WHO says its regions of Southeast Asia, eastern Mediterranean, western Pacific, and the Americas are also at risk. While research for a vaccine and therapeutics for malaria had been on for nearly half-a-century, success has been elusive until recently. While preventive and treatment interventions have continued (bed nets and indoor residual insecticide spraying) over the years, it was clear that the best tool against the constantly mutating pathogen would not emerge until an effective vaccine was at hand. Editorial | Killing the chills: On the malaria vaccine As Matthew B. Laurens argues in a paper in Human Vaccines and Immunotherapeutics: \u201cAn effective malaria vaccine would be an important tool to combat the enormous socioeconomic burden caused by this disease. Vaccines promote both individual and public health, and are thus considered among the most highly successful public health tools. After provision of clean water and sanitation, vaccination against infectious diseases has contributed the greatest to public health worldwide, compared with other human interventions.\u201d And it was at a time when it was believed that anti-malarial research was flailing, that RTS,S did emerge. Pilot projects rolled out in sub-Saharan Africa showed that among children aged 5-17 months who received the recommended four doses of RTS,S, the vaccine prevented approximately 4 in 10 (39%) cases of malaria over four years of follow-up; about 3 in 10 (29%) cases of severe malaria, with a significant reduction in overall hospital admissions due to malaria or severe anaemia (a side effect). The need for blood transfusions to correct life-threatening anaemia also came down by 29%. RTS,S/AS01 is a recombinant protein-based vaccine that acts against P. falciparum, believed to be the deadliest malaria parasite globally and the most prevalent in Africa. It reportedly offers no protection against P.vivax malaria, found in many countries outside Africa. The development of the vaccine was led by pharma major GSK over 30 years ago. In 2001, GSK began collaborating with PATH\u2019s Malaria Vaccine Initiative (MVI). A five-year Phase 3 efficacy and safety trial that concluded in 2014 was implemented through a partnership between GSK and MVI, with support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and a network of African research centres. In July 2015, the European Medicines Agency authorised the use of the vaccine, concluding that the benefits of the vaccine outweighed the risks. Known side-effects include pain and swelling at the injection site and fever, similar to the other children\u2019s vaccines. It is associated with an increased risk of febrile seizures within seven days of administration. In the Phase 3 trial, children who had febrile seizures after vaccination recovered completely, and there were no long-lasting consequences, the WHO reported. Pilots were launched in Malawi, Ghana, and Kenya over 2019. Health workers reported that the vaccine was easy to introduce and integrate into their schedule. The data were submitted to the WHO\u2019s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunisation and the Malaria Policy Advisory Committee that gave the go-ahead for the first ever anti-malarial vaccine. Also read | Bharat Biotech to make malaria vaccine Malaria is a major public health problem in India, endemic to many States, and involves multiple Plasmodium species, including P. falciparum, said the authors of a paper in Acta Tropica, an international journal on infectious diseases. India will therefore benefit from the vaccine, and Bharat Biotech has entered into a partnership with GSK for technology transfer and production. This vaccine is likely to be ready for use in India, in a couple of years, as per reports.

She later appeared in some TV shows but found further acclaim with the 2004 Shah Rukh Khan-starrer \u201cSwades\u201d. Some of her other notable performances were in Aamir Khan-backed \u201cPeepli Live\u201d, in which she essayed the role a bidi-smoking cantankerous mother-in-law and Salman Khan-led \"Sultan\", in which she featured as the superstar's uber-cool grandmother. She also played Nawazuddin Siddiqui's grandmother in \u201cPhotograph\u201d. But her most memorable performance was as the fiesty Fatima Begum, wife of megastar Amitabh Bachchan's character in \u201cGulabo Sitabo\u201d, directed by Shoojit Sircar. In her interview with PTI, the actor had expressed happiness over the praise for scene-stealing performance in the movie. \"Maine suna ki Begum baazi maar le jaati hai picture mein. ( I have heard that Begum outruns everyone in the film). Such praise about my character makes me happy,\" she had said in the June 2020 interview. In the film she played a 95-year-old wife to Bachchan's 78-year-old Mirza who is awaiting his Begum's death to finally own Fatima Mahal, the derelict mansion at the centre of the conflict. But in the final moments of the film, Begum manages to one up Mirza in his own game. Screenwriter Juhi Chaturvedi, who penned \u201cGulabo Sitabo\u201d, paid tributes to Jafar. \u201cBegum is gone Farrukh ji, there was no one, and there will be no one like you. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for allowing us to connect with you. Please stay safe in the other world of Allah. RIP #FarrukhJaffar #Begum #FattoBi #FatimaBegum #GulaboSitabo,\u201d she wrote on Instagram, alongside a picture of the actor. Jafar was married to journalist-politician Syed Muhammad Jaffar, and is survived by daughters, Mehru and Shaheen.
